<h3>THE UNCANNY UNDER FIRE</h3>

<p class="noin">"<span class="smcap">Do</span> you think there is anything in it?" He
was a clean-set six-foot specimen of English
manhood, an officer of the R.F.A. wounded
at Mons, who spoke. "I mean I haven't
studied these subjects much&mdash;in fact, I
haven't studied them at all. Sport is more
in my line than spiritualism and that kind
of thing, but when you have experiences
brought under your very nose again and
again, you cannot help thinking there must
be something in such things." He had just
told me that in the last few minutes' sleep
he managed to get on the march to Mons he
dreamt that he was unable to sit his horse.
The next day he was wounded inside his right
knee, not seriously, but sufficient to stop him
riding for a week or two. "I should never
have thought anything more of it&mdash;I mean,
connecting the dream with the ill-luck&mdash;but
in the South African campaign there were
quite remarkable instances. You see, at
such times when you are playing hide-and-seek<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
with shrapnel, officers and men get very
chummy when we do get a spell for a talk.
The Tommies give us their confidences, and
ask us all kinds of strange questions about
religious and super-natural things."</p>

<p>Take premonitions, for example. How
shall we account for the British soldier's
actual versions of the matter? There are
countless stories in this war, in every war, of
men having a warning, a sub-conscious certainty
of death. The battlefield is armed
with a full battery of shot, which thrill with
human interest and have around them a halo
of something uncanny, supernormal. It may
be that in the stress and shock of battle the
strings&mdash;some of the strings&mdash;of the human
instrument get broken; that poor Tommy,
gazing into the night of the long silence,
becomes a prey to morbid fancies, which
presently are worked up into premonitions.
There may be something in this, but the men
of inaction are more prone to fancies than
men on active service. Another theory suggests
that the same power within which
questions, supplies an answer. It may be
so; but no one is anxious for the answer
Death brings. One can only smile at the
crass stupidity of most of the explanations
given by those who deny the existence of
super-natural agencies and powers. The
region of spiritual dynamics is destined to be
the science of the future.</p>

<p>In a somewhat sceptical age it is worth<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
while noticing that from the earliest dawn of
history, under varying forms of government
and civilisation with which we are acquainted,
the belief in premonitions was unchallenged.
The old Greeks and Latins were the keenest
thinkers the world so far has seen; yet they
believed in ghosts, omens, and premonitions.
(They would smile in lofty scorn at some of
the superstitions to-day taught under the
Elementary Education Act of 1870.) Unbelief
in such things super-natural, therefore,
cannot be accepted as a sign of lofty mentality.
A journalistic friend was staying
with me some few months ago. We were
sitting smoking rather late after dinner.
"Do you believe in ghosts?" I asked.
"Don't be so absurdly foolish!" he cried
angrily. "That's all right," I remarked
quietly. "Now I know you won't mind
sleeping in our haunted room; many foolish
people do object." "Great Scott!" he
ejaculated, "no haunted room for me!"
Nor would he even look at it. He would not
face the logical sequence of his dogmatic
unbelief. Only a brave man dare express all
he believes.</p>

<p>Now it is well known that every advance
in scientific knowledge is greeted with mocking
laughter. We know the jeers with which
even clever men greeted the Marconi claims.
It is not so many years ago that a distinguished
member of the French Academy of
Science rose up amongst his colleagues and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
pronounced the Edison phonograph to be
nothing more than an acoustical illusion.
So we are told that soldiers' visions are
optical illusions. That is no answer. Call
them optical delusions if you like, then the
query arises what causes these optical delusions,
of which we have countless instances,
which inform a man of the hour, and sometimes
the manner, of his death? To call
an effect by another name does not dispose
of the cause of such effect, nor is it any
solution of the mystery.</p>

<p>Few thinkers now, worthy of the name,
seriously dispute the existence of super-natural
forces and influences. The whole
system of Christianity, of belief in all ages,
is founded upon such things. To-day front-rank
men are investigating in avenues of
research where once they sneered. There is
much fraud and cheap talk in ordinary life,
but not under fire. Men are not cheap then,
nor are they paltry. Strange that where
death is busiest the evidence of life beyond
and above it all should abound. The invisible,
full of awe, is also full of teaching,
it is pregnant with whispers. The mind,
tuned up to a new tension, receives all kinds
of Marconi-like messages. What sends such
whispers? Is it that in the moment of
supreme self-sacrifice and splendid devotion
to duty that spiritual perceptions are sharpened?
Who shall say? "He was hit, and
he rushed forward shouting, 'Why, there's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
my&mdash;&mdash;' then he dropped dead, but he saw
someone, of that I am sure." So spoke a man
of the A.S.C., who saw his comrade die.
Deep calls to deep, and if we put our ear to
the call we may hear the message. On the
battlefield, as in no other place, there is the
call of soul to soul, of heart to heart, intensified
by all our powers of emotion, which duty
calls forth at their best. Tommy Atkins
stares more fixedly into the dim future, the
greater the gloom the more he searches for
the gleam, and sometimes it is vouchsafed to
him. There is no doubt that mind calls to
mind. After all, time and space are artificial
things. They cannot be spiritual barriers.
Why should a mother, thinking of her lad at
the front in a supreme moment of affection
and deep yearning, not be able to do what
frequently happens unconsciously among ordinary
acquaintances? Often a thought will
pass from one mind to another in a moment
of silence.</p>

<p>The uncanny under fire must take its place
among things to be investigated, the evidence
is too convincing to be pooh-poohed. Science
and philosophy are now boldly entering the
dim regions of the occult in search of its
laws; on the battlefield Tommy Atkins is
already there thinking over weird things and
he comes to conclusions, finding the lights
by which he steers.</p>

<p>This chapter could not be complete without
mentioning another mystery of the battlefield:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
it is this&mdash;the number of instances in
which the Germans have savagely pounded a
church with their artillery, only to find on
entering the ruin that the cross was still there
erect and intact. One Uhlan soldier climbed
upon an altar to smash a crucifix, slipped and
put his ankle out. That may be a coincidence.
Next moment a shell killed him
and one of his comrades, the crucifix remained
uninjured. Soldiers, French and British, talk
of these uncanny things, interpreting them
in several ways, but each of these ways is the
pathway of the spirit&mdash;perhaps part of the
altar steps on which men climb up through
the darkness to God.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<h3>WAR THE REVEALER</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">War</span> is not only the Great Educator, it is the
Great Revealer. Its marches and bivouacs,
its battles, its commonplaces and surprises,
its trials and its triumphs, are a singular
school of experience. The various impacts
upon man's psychological anatomy produce
strange results. They seem like the blows of
some Invisible Sculptor, producing out of
commonplace material a hero and it may be
a demi-god. The opening orchestra of shot
and shell braces up the mind of the soldier
and attunes it up to receive new sensitiveness.
The bullets play strange dirges on the strings
of life before they break them, and each dirge
has its theme, some song of spiritual things.
His gaze is towards the sky line and he sees
strange things, a whole battery of lights each
of which is in its way a revelation. The
battle chorus crying to the night of long
silence becomes a prayer, and the response
is ever helpful.</p>

<p>The individual amid the thunder of his
surroundings in the red surge of battle somehow
never allows his soul to become obscured.
It is taking impressions which later in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
day as he sits by the camp fire cause him to
think and to reach conclusions which leave
him a different man from what he has been.
We see this in the glow of the soldiers' letters
to those he loves: he has come within the
shadow of the Divine Reality as the wondrous
book of Life and Death opens on the battlefield.
The result is the Soldier's Gospel. It
would cause the devotees of little Bethel to
faint with its crude "superstitions" and
absence of meaningless and stupid dogma
yet its grip of spiritual things and Divine
Aid would make the ordinary "go to meeting"
Christian gape with astonishment. The
soldier's simple faith, his willing endurance,
his quiet heroisms, his silent self-sacrifice,
though they call for no louder name than
duty, are just those chords which link him
to the Great Heroism which saw its culmination
in Calvary. After all, deeds only are
the words of love.</p>

<p>The Soldier's Gospel is a wonderful revelation:
the world grows gratefully small as it
appreciates its work, worth and effect upon the
man. All the lights by which he steers sum
up good citizenship rather than sectarianship.
We had long ceased to cultivate the former.</p>

<p>"There goes a hospital ship," and a
Commander of one of H.M. Patrols pointed
out to me a transport full of wounded. We
thought in pity of that array of maimed men,
of silent suffering, of bandages, slings, crutches
and artificial limbs, but suddenly there arose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
from the transport a mighty cheer of greeting
and salutation to the white ensign. That
was the reply of war's wreckage to those who
pitied. It is a wonderful Gospel that produces
this. But the invisible, while full of
awe, does not daunt him, the soldier reaches
out towards the rather unknown searching for
light and finding it. Under fire means so
much, it is filled up with so many experiences,
you march through a lifetime in a few seconds,
you get new views of the past years from
another angle of vision. Shadow and darkness
and doubt are lifted, the soldier is frank
and honest, he is not hide-bound by petty
superstitions, he is willing fairly to consider
and weigh all sensations, visions and inner
illuminations. He is not blinded with the
dogma of either agnosticism or sectarianism,
while his sense of humour saves him from
many of the errors of the various "Christian"
brotherhoods. Curious enough, the people
who object to duty, who are unwilling to
strike a blow for righteousness, invariably
belong to some of the freak sects and are
devotees of sectarianism in its narrowest
meaning.</p>

<p>No doubt "Vicarious Suffering" the root
doctrine of many sects in this country is
responsible for the general shirking of duty
on the part of so many men to-day. Men
look to the ballot box for their meat in due
season. They want all the privileges of
citizenship without the responsibilities. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
sects of to-day in teaching that the historic
Christ took all our sins upon His shoulder
have produced a type of sentimental immoralist
who creeps under the shelter of the
Cross, content that Christ should suffer in
his place. So long as the Cross does not
offend his eyesight, he is willing to find refuge
in its shadow. Where selfishness reigns there
is no vision. The gaze is upon gain, personal
comfort, things entirely earthly. A man
who is always looking at mud thinks in terms
of mud. Just as a great naturalist confesses
a loss of the finer sense of music, so there is
the loss of the spiritual vision, for the spiritual
sense is just as real as any other sense, but
it can become useless and drop out of our
life, if we do not value it and no longer use it.
There are people with an artistic sense.
There are more without it.</p>

<p>The doctrine of the atonement is used to
promote the crude idea that to put our
responsibilities upon others is more religious
than facing them oneself. Christ's atonement
is no isolated fact in history to make
men cowards, but a sustained attitude of
devotion in which every man and woman is to
take a part. Instead of thanking Christ for
hanging there upon the Cross in our place we
should strive for the same courage, the same
endurance, the supreme devotion to duty and
the vision of Divine Aid will be ours perhaps
in Angel form. To the brave in all ages has
come the vision of higher things.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span></p>
<h2>III</h2>

<h3>THE SOUL'S BOUNDARY LINE</h3>

<p class="noin">"<span class="smcap">I never</span> was religious, but this business is
changing me and many thousands more," so
writes a soldier. From another soldier's letter
we get, "War is the most sobering influence
I know ... it sobers their every day.
They listen more attentively to the religious
services. Sometimes I wish for the sake of
the morals of our army that we were always
at war."</p>

<p>When I was in Northern France I came in
contact with many wounded French soldiers,
men who had gone to the front as atheists
and returned firm believers. "Thank the
good God I have really seen. I fell wounded
in twenty-three places they tell me. I fell
cursing a God I did not believe in: then a
cold hand was laid upon my brow. I looked
up and saw&mdash;ah! my God! how beautiful a
Being. Now I do not want, I do not care to
live for I want to see that beautiful Being
again. I know I shall. Leave me. See to
the others." This was a voluntary statement
of a French soldier who called me to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
his side simply to light a cigarette for him.
I left him perfectly happy and it was quite
true about his number of wounds. He lived
only a few hours and he knew that he was
dying. Men do not usually tell lies on their
death beds.</p>

<p>Wonderful is the warp and woof of life
under fire. It is the parade of the living,
the dead and those on the borderland. Men
go through the whole gamut of emotions.
War is an object lesson of laughter and tears
playing hide and seek with each other. The
tragedy and the comedy follow close on each
other's heels. Deep calls not only to deep
but to shallow as well, and in the end all notes
harmonize. Where the swathe of the scythe
is wide men's souls expand in heart qualities.
Amidst the wreckage of a battlefield he picks
up all kinds of things, every faculty picks up
something and they become contributions to
soul force. The greater the gloom the more
the soldier searches for the gleam. Religion
and resolution meet in the soldier and give
him deeper vision. He hears his comrade
say, "I shall be taken to-day, give this
to &mdash;&mdash;." Examples of this premonition
abound. He enters a bombarded village, the
only thing standing intact frequently is a
figure of Christ crucified, or the Madonna
looking down upon a mass of crumbling ruin.
These facts are again and again verified by
photographs. Often the talk of the camp as
the men settle down by the fire is of the weird<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
and the uncanny that has happened during
the day; and there are pauses when the
soldiers stare into the embers and forget to
suck their pipes.</p>

<p>To explain the book of life, one would
require the scrolls of eternity. War throws
light on some of its stray pages as they flutter
for a second on the wings of time and then
disappear, but not before it has flung its
cressets of light upon the black pall of doubt.
Everyone now talks of psychic phenomena.
In a paltry generation of superficial thinking
the subject was one for jest, but there is far
more in it than jesters are likely to discover.
Mocking laughter never discovered anything
except the vacuous fool. The appearances of
spiritual beings give but scant opportunity for
examination but serious investigation has now
taken the place of cheap sneering. After all
religion is founded upon a philosophy of
apparitions. The vision of angels at Mons
is no new thing. Catholicism is founded on
such visions and no religion worthy of the
name is without its story of angels. New
aspects of matter have laid many materialistic
theories in the dust, the mysterious potencies
of matter which the latest science is revealing,
the energy of electrons, and radium are
giving us a new science of super-sensual
physics and with it new vistas of thought.</p>

<p>It is no longer necessary to apologize for
the work of psychic research, that is among
intelligent people. Light is gaining on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
darkness. "I felt another hand assisting me
to steer," said a sailor man to me who vainly
tried to explain how he kept his boat from
what appeared certain destruction. He
would scorn to be called a religious man.
"There is nothing of the ranter in me&mdash;you
know sir," and he used uncomplimentary
remarks which I omit. "But there sir, it was
no skill of mine. All I saw was death and
destruction for me and my mates, yet I knew
we should pull through all right. There was
another that shipped as passenger in the
darkness."</p>

<p>The question of immortality and of the
existence of spiritual entities which had been
relegated to the limits of illusions and dreams
in Victorian times by the fumbling amateur
philosophers of that day, can now be discussed
with quiet in the old philosophic vein
which characterized the great age of thought
when Greek sages argued in the Gardens of
Athens. This fact alone justifies a book of
the present character. The bumptious and
dull ass who announces "Miracles do not
happen," is now seen in true perspective and
he cuts a poor figure.</p>

<p>Apparitions, telepathy and clairvoyance
are not explanations, but names for facts
demanding separate explanations. In regard
to such the "ecclesiastical damn" and the
"scientific damn" have been freely used.
If men have been hypnotized by ghost stories,
they certainly have been deluded by stories<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
of unnatural science. To deny activities of
life natural and super-natural is rather silly
considering no man has solved the life principle.
The atoms forming the material of
the brain may be proved ultimately to be
identical with those that compose a jelly-fish
or a jar of margarine, and brain appears to
be the organ of mind, but it is mind that
grasps things, places things, and thinks.
Life is concerned with <i>thought</i> as well as
atoms. It receives thoughts from all sides,
sometimes it claims to detect the thought
giver&mdash;and that is to have a fuller vision.
Men think quickly on the field of battle.
They are not constrained by a narrow education
and a narrower conventionalism to limit
their thoughts to what others think in their
own circle.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span></p>
<h2>IV</h2>

<h3>THE SPIRITUAL ENTITY</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Why</span> is it that men in all ages, the best of
men, the most gifted of men, with the evidence
of the senses so strongly against them, have
believed that a spiritual personal entity survives
death's disaster? That men do so is
seen in all literature and witnessed to in all
lands. Vedic hymns, 3,500 years old sing
of a spiritual body with as clear a vision as
S. Paul. We are collecting the evidence
that has floated down the ages and examining
it with a new criticism. The attitude of
"Pooh! Bah!" of Early Victorian times is
no longer the mark of superiority. It is now,
as it was then, the mark not only of ignorance
but stupid dullness. The frame of mind
which used to dismiss everything with the
word "impossible" is now recognized not
as science but ignorance. The researches of
a Crookes, of a Sir Oliver Lodge, Myers,
Gurney, Rochas, Gabriel Delanne, Lombroso,
in the region of the occult command serious
attention. Swedenborg communicated messages
from people who had long passed to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
their relatives on matters of fact which were
found accurate in every detail.</p>

<p>M. Rochas speaks of an externalized consciousness
which feels a touch. Within man
is the plant and machinery of all kinds of
faculties, one is the perception of the spiritual.
Had it been trained like his sense of music,
we should no longer be in the dark of despair
over our dead. The trend of thought to-day
is to show man a spiritual being in a spiritual
universe, that death is merely transition.
If not, then God is the Cosmic Murderer.
The spiritual sense of man is his faculty of
response to the spiritual world around him,
just as his musical sense is his measure of
response and his reception of the world of
music around him. By some magic in the
red surge of war, this spiritual response is
sharpened and quickened as every other
sense is, and the soldier sees visions. Man
working within time and space is influenced
by what is beyond the one and the other, the
full significance of this world would seem to
be in another scheme of things to which this
is only the vestibule. The soul's wave movements
have their laws. In that soul is some
fine Marconi-like instrument which registers
impressions, and from time to time receives
spiritual warnings and perceives spiritual
beings. Serious men are now boldly investigating.
Little help comes from the sectarians
who seem to begrudge God his
universe; everything has to be cheapened to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
the worm's-eye view of little Bethel, which
steeped in politics has long lost sense of the
spiritual. The old Greeks and Latins were
acute thinkers, yet they believed in spiritual
beings and their appearances. It was only
in the days of cheap thinking that it required
a special valour to express belief in the super-natural.
The fact is, most people are like
the devils of scripture who "believe and
tremble" without admitting the authority
of their belief. It is refreshing to find a
writer like Mr. W. S. Lilley in the <i>Nineteenth
Century</i> professing his absolute belief in
ghosts. To man, and it would appear to
man alone on this plane, it is given to explore
the unknown and to establish the communion
of soul with soul.</p>

<p>After all it is a question of evidence. If
a man say "I won't believe in anything
super-natural whatever the evidence may be,"
it is best to leave him to his folly. If he will
accept the evidence that would pass muster
in a court of law, then you have a common
ground, you can weigh evidence. To me the
evidence for spiritual appearances is overwhelming
looking at it from the strictly legal
angle of vision.</p>

<p>In years gone by the scientific genius began
with the assertion that everything must have
had a beginning, and to assert that there was
a spiritual Being with no beginning was
nonsense. To the dim indistinct crowd such
appeared to be clever reasoning. But our<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
very consciousness insists that there is something
which had no beginning, and Reason
adds, "else there could be nothing now."
For example, Space could not have had a
beginning, that Duration could not, that
Truth could not, that somehow, somewhere
these Three Eternals must have been co-eternal,
incomprehensible. And in this
Trinity "none is afore or after the other,"
which recalls the Athanasian Creed.</p>

<p>I cannot prove that Truth had no beginning,
yet my consciousness tells me at no period
was it laid down as something new, that the
shortest distance between two points would
be a straight line. No mathematician has
ever proved that there is no boundary to
space, but something within me tells me that
there can be no such boundary. Even Reason
tells me that an impassable boundary would
only serve to indicate the unlimited extension
beyond.</p>

<p>In all ages we have the mystic. Now the
mystic is common to all religions. He is the
man who has felt the touch of spiritual beings,
the call of Heavenly things, and we have to
explain him. In seeking to do this we shall
realize some of the truth of the things soldiers
see which we have called "The Weird in
War."</p>

<h3>ANGELS</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> evidence for the existence and the
appearance of angels does not rest on the
testimony merely of men who fought at Mons.
But even that evidence which is accepted by
the talented author of <i>The Bowmen</i> requires
some explaining away and he admits that
there is a difficulty in ignoring it. But there
is the accumulating evidence of the ages.
When we have explained away the soldiers'
delusions, we have to confront those of the
world's wisest sons&mdash;giants in thought. We
have to confront the fact that all great religions
have the theory of angels.</p>

<p>After all, every good thought may be the
whisper of an angel, every beautiful prospect
may be but the glint of the wing, every ray
of light and heat but the waving of the robes
of those higher spiritual intelligences which
rush hither and thither on God's service,
whose faces see God in Heaven. Such a
belief is just as sound, and far more philosophical
than any of the guesses I have read<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
so far, given us as "explanation" of such
phenomena.</p>

<p>I am in hearty agreement with much that
Mr. Arthur Machen writes in his book <i>The
Bowmen</i>. It is a book everyone should read.
That splendid story of failure and triumph,
the Retreat from Mons, prompted him to
write a story on an Angelic Host coming to
the aid of the British force. He wrote it
after the manner of the journalist who is an
eye-witness of the event. Many people still
believe what they read in the newspapers;
and many people believed his story. But
he is altogether wrong when he imagines that
he is the author of the belief in Angelic
visions. I was in France hearing stories of
angelic intervention long before Mr. Machen
wrote his delightful yarn. A frog might as
well imagine that his croak is responsible for
the whole world of music, as to postulate that
his story gave rise to the theory of Angels.
Men had visions of such long before the first
stone of our venerable shrine at Westminster
was laid, before the Romans built their first
mud huts in the valley of the Tiber, before
the Pyramids raised their terrific greatness
to the heavens. So Mr. Machen need not
concern himself on that score.</p>

<p>The Anglican Church has failed dismally
to keep before people the teaching of the
Church in regard to Angels and Angelic
intervention in the affairs of men. There I
am in entire agreement with Mr. Machen.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Soldiers tell their stories of angels and a few
bishops cackle; but not one of them dares
to speak of the fuller belief of the Church in
angels and the soul-inspiring mystery of the
Communion of Saints, the inter-relationship
between those on the earth-plane and those
who have passed to the higher life. The
hardworking priest in the slums fearlessly
proclaims this one sacrament of life with the
Divine Life, his belief in angels and their help,
in saints and their prayers, and because he
believes he is able to work under conditions
which make life for a cultured man almost
intolerable. But he works, thankful to be
left alone by his bishop: for war has declared
a close time for ritualistic curates. But the
soldier whose patriotism he has nurtured
writes home to him telling frankly his experiences,
his dreams, his visions. I have
seen many of these letters. The writers are
not liars nor are they hysterical subjects, but
fine specimens of healthy manhood. Here
and there a dissenting divine has raised his
voice to declare there may be something in
these stories of angels, but the dissenting
pulpit is under the despotism of the pew and
cry of "Rome" is enough. "Honest doubt"
is always sure of a sympathetic audience,
"honest belief" is greeted with the cry of
superstition or the cuckoo cry of "Popery."</p>

<p>A soldier sees something super-natural.
Some one says I know a hundred or a thousand
soldiers who did not see it. A man may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
witness a murder. His evidence is accepted
in the law courts. They do not call the
hundred thousand people who did not see it
in proof that no murder was perpetrated.
Few people know the fundamental principles
of evidence. More people misuse it.</p>

<h3>FELLOWSHIP WITH THE UNSEEN</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Religion</span> is man's fellowship with the Unseen,
and it would seem that bishops and
various crank divines are determined that
such a belief shall be discouraged. Man's
nature has upon it the Hall Marks of Heaven.
Woven into man's anatomical texture we find
faculties that transcend this world, that are
for ever intent upon the waves that beat
upon us from another shore. He sees the
coastline of another world to which he commits
his dead. We call such people Mystics,
Catholics, Seers, etc. They are the people
who have had touch with the Unseen. After
all, the people with actual personal experience
of spiritual power, who shape their lives by
their experience are the real assets of belief.</p>

<p>Man may or may not be sprung from the
beast, he may or may not have been raised
from slime. Man's spirit did not arise in
slime, that at all events came from a race of
flame. Dust will not account for everything.</p>

<p>The Church in its greatest office of all, the
Communion Service, claims to worship in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
union with "Angels and Archangels and with
<i>all</i> the Company of Heaven." Having proclaimed
this tremendous fact the Church, for
the most part leaves it, and bishops view any
further annunciation of the fact with suspicion
and sometimes with threats.</p>

<p>On one solemn day in the year the Church
invokes S. Michael and all Angels. S.
Michael's Mass as it is still called. The old
teaching of the Church bids us lift our eyes
to behold those more intimate intelligences
which stand nearer the Great and Central
Mystery. When a soldier stumbles by chance
upon one of those higher beings he is regarded
as the victim of hallucination, of superstition
or drink or all of them. A chaplain with dull
German Protestantism obscuring his view of
spiritual things treats him as some unclean
thing. Dissent in England for years has
been synonymous with pro-Germanism. It
has been at war with the historic creed of
Christendom. It was better for their aims
that angels should not exist.</p>

<p>Before dull German Protestantism with its
gross materialism raised the plentiful crop
of sects in England, our country was known
through Europe as "Merrie England." Our
people loved the festival of S. Michael. S.
Michael's Mass was a red letter day. The
Communion and Inter-Communion of earth
with heaven was emphasized. Families met
that day to pray and feast, lovers plighted
their troth, gatherings of relatives and friends<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
was the rule, joy was the key-note. Then
dissent raised its ugly head, dissent that had
its birth in Germany. These kill-joys got
the upper hand. The recognition of the
Christ-Mass, Christmas and the Michael-Mass,
Michaelmas, was put down by law. Dissent
has never hesitated to use compulsion when
it lay ready to hand to enforce materialism.
So belief in angels well nigh ceased to exist.
To-day the revival comes from actual experience
rather than from church teaching.
The antagonism to such belief amounts to
unreasonable heights of folly. Luther has so
long occupied the place of Christ that dissent
has forgotten what Christ taught us in regard
to angels. We ignore the fact that He
claimed to have seen angels, and to have had
their help and ministration. When politics
mix with religion, spirituality dies, there is
no vision, for there is little belief and less
sincerity. No wonder the soldier's vision of
angels strikes them as something altogether
beyond the pale of belief.</p>

<p>It is time that our "spiritual fathers" and
other stepfathers began to give us a lead in
spiritual things. We are burdened with
bishops who play to the gallery and the
cheaper press, who would rather take a confirmation
service in a coal-pit than in a
consecrated shrine of prayer, for the simple
reason that "Confirmation in a Coal-pit"
gets a flaming advertisement in every paper.
Their vision is set on notoriety: the spiritual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
vision recedes. How can they have sympathy
with those who pierce the boundary
line that separates this world from a higher
plane?</p>

<p>Men who have spent their lives on office
seeking can never be seers or priests. Parsons
who beat the political drum may rise to
power political, never to the power spiritual.
The vision glorious is to those who face duty,
self-sacrifice, and see in them the Divine Call,
who believe in the sacrifice of the Gospel
rather than its comfort. The charlatan must
not dominate the Christian in our spiritual
pastors, if it do, then such are not qualified
to minister in spiritual things.</p>

<h2>VII</h2>

<h3>THE WHITE COMRADE</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">The</span> story that angels fought on the side of
the Allies in the battle of Mons must rest upon
evidence, coupled with experience. If we
begin by assuming that there can be no intelligences
in the universe unless they are
clothed in the regulated fashion, then no
amount of evidence will suffice. It is a
worm's-eye view that regards man as the last
word in mind.</p>

<p>Meanwhile France is pursuing the evidence
for another story exclusively of French origin
and vouched for by men to whom the belief
in spiritual beings is repugnant, viz., the
apparition of "Le Camarade Blanc," of
whom at Nancy, in the Argonne, at Soissons
and Ypres men talked with hushed voices
but with the quiet assurance of men who had
seen. It must be something arresting which
changes an atheist into a mystic. Again and
again the French wounded speak of a man in
white bending over them as they lay on the
field helpless, and ministering relief. The
mysterious one whom our allies call the "Comrade
in White" appears simultaneously on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
different parts of the battlefield. His mission
ever is one of mercy.</p>

<p><i>The Living Church</i> reprints from <i>Work and
Life</i> an article giving a full account of "The
White Comrade," furnished by a wounded
soldier. All accounts agree in the main facts.
He is generally observed after "severe fighting,"
he appears where "death is busiest,"
he "ignores shot and shell," he is ever "calm,
collected," and brings with him an atmosphere
of peace. Men of the 87th and 128th French
Infantry who have been fighting in the
Argonne, have seen him, and on several
occasions he has been seen in the trenches.</p>

<p>The soldier's account which appeared in
<i>The Living Church</i> is worth reading. It is
not conclusive evidence, but the number of
such experiences has value on the great subject
of Spiritual Intervention. Religion
pledges itself to such a belief. This is the
soldier's story, one of many similar stories:</p>

<p>"It was the next day. At noon we got
word to take the trenches in front of us.
They were two hundred yards away, and we
weren't well started till we knew that the big
guns had failed in their work of preparation.
We had advanced 150 yards when we found
it was no good. Our captain called to us to
take cover, and just then I was shot through
both legs.</p>

<p>"I fell into a hole of some sort. I suppose
I fainted, for when I opened my eyes I was
all alone. The pain was horrible, but I didn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
dare to move lest the Germans should see me,
for they were only fifty yards away, and I
did not expect mercy. I was glad when the
twilight came. There were men in my own
company who would run any risk in the
darkness if they thought a comrade was still
alive.</p>

<p>"The night fell, and soon I heard a step,
not stealthy, as I expected, but quiet and
firm, as if neither darkness nor death could
check those untroubled feet. So little did I
guess what was coming that, even when I saw
the gleam of white in the darkness I thought it
was a peasant in a white smock, or perhaps
a woman deranged. Suddenly I guessed that
it was 'The Comrade in White.'</p>

<p>"At that very moment the German rifles
began to shoot. The bullets could scarcely
miss such a target, for he flung out his arms
as though in entreaty, and then drew them
back till he stood like one of those wayside
crosses that we saw so often as we marched
through France. And he spoke. The words
sounded familiar, but all I remember was the
beginning, 'If thou hadst known,' and the
ending, 'but now they are hid from thine
eyes.' And then he stooped and gathered me
into his arms&mdash;me, the biggest man in the
regiment&mdash;and carried me as if I had been a
child.</p>

<p>"I must have fainted again, for I awoke
to consciousness in a little cave by a stream,
and 'The Comrade in White' was washing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
my wounds and binding them up. I wanted
to know what I could do for my friend to help
him or to serve him. He was looking toward
the stream and his hands were clasped
in prayer; and then I saw that he, too, had
been wounded. I could see, as it were, a
shot-wound in his hand, and as he prayed a
drop of blood gathered and fell to the ground.
I cried out. I could not help it, for that
wound of his seemed to be a more awful
thing than any that bitter war had shown
me. 'You are wounded, too,' I said. Perhaps
he heard me, perhaps it was the look on
my face, but he answered gently: 'This is
an old wound, but it has troubled me of late.'
And then I noticed sorrowfully that the same
cruel mark was on his feet. You will wonder
that I did not know sooner. I wonder myself.
But it was only when I saw his feet that I
knew him."</p>

<p>An incident which left a great impression
upon me occurred at a hospital in North West
France in September 1914 quite early in the
war. I was visiting some wounded English
and French soldiers. One poor fellow, a
Parisian, called me to his side. "Come close,
monsieur, for I would talk in a whisper. You
are English&mdash;yes: and you English are
common sense, practical&mdash;tell me&mdash;do you
believe in God and angels, such things as
priests teach children and women?"</p>

<p>"My measure of experience in life has
compelled my belief in angels or spiritual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
beings, and common sense demands my
belief in a Supreme Mind which I call God,
the one Basic Fact," I replied.</p>

<p>"Monsieur I would talk with you. Do
you believe that this God has priests to reveal
such things to us?"</p>

<p>"The Great Supreme Mind has priests,
leaders, prophets, in all departments of knowledge,
music, mathematics, chemistry, navigation
or engineering&mdash;why should He not
have chosen instruments to reveal theological
truth?"</p>

<p>He lay some time quiet, then he said, "It
is good; now I feel I can tell you, for you
will not smile. For years, ever since I could
think, I have been an atheist. I went into
this war an atheist. A few days ago a shell
burst near me and I was wounded in twenty-nine
places." (This statement was subsequently
substantiated by the doctor and a
nursing sister of mercy.) "Monsieur, I was
in great pain: then suddenly a kind face was
looking into mine, something touched my
brow, the awful pain ceased. 'You called
me,' a soft voice said. Then I remembered
that when I was wounded I had cried, 'Oh,
my God!' and I laughed, monsieur, for I was
an atheist. Then I lost consciousness with
that kind face still bending over me. Now
I lie and think of that kind face. The doctors
say maybe I shall recover, and the sisters
here say to me that it is all in the Good God's
hands and I am content. I say it is all in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
Good God's hands. When that kind face
was looking into mine I cried out 'I am an
atheist,' and he just smiled and said 'But you
called me.'"</p>

<p>I offered to get a priest for the poor fellow,
but he shook his head. "No, monsieur. I
have been an enemy of priests all my life&mdash;an
enemy of religion&mdash;the Church. To offer
the remaining days of my wreckage to God&mdash;no&mdash;I
have but a few hours to live, and I
would think of that kind face, and when I
think of it the pain ceases. Ah, monsieur, I
had wonderful arguments to show that there
was no God, and that the clerics are the
people's enemies&mdash;yet when I was struck
down I called 'Oh, my God!' It is comical.
That is why the kind face smiled."</p>

<p>Another wounded French soldier said to
me: "When I go back to Toulon I shall have
something to say to my comrades. I always
thought priests were only half men, but my
God! I have seen them fight. It is magnificent.
A priest led us when we hesitated,
I got my two wounds following him&mdash;a priest.
Oh! it is truly unbelievable to think that I
should follow a priest. He led us to triumph.
He led me to something more. That day I
knew religion was true. I saw something in
his face. I saw it again when he fell wounded,
and I was wounded but I could only think of
him. Ah, life is droll&mdash;Now I go back to
Toulon with two bad wounds and a religion.
Priests&mdash;I have seen them fight, and I lie and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
laugh at myself and my comrades as fools
for we thought of them as mere amusements
for women and children. I saw priests go
forward where my noble comrades held
back&mdash;my noble comrades who sneer at
priests. It is droll."</p>

<h3>OMBOS</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">We</span> were talking at the club about spirit
manifestations, and retailing the usual second
or third-hand accounts of family spooks and
deceased aunts showing themselves to their
sorrowing relatives.</p>

<p>"It is strange the tricks which our brains
will sometimes play us," said Barton. "I
remember once seeing a ghost myself, and I
can tell you that the sensation is a very curious
one. It was a good many years ago, when
I was out in Bombay in the National Indian
Bank, and I had been sitting up until the
early hours trying to trace some fraudulent
entries in the bank's books by one of our
clerks who had absconded with a considerable
sum of money.</p>

<p>"Everybody in the bank building had long
since gone home or to bed, where I ought
to have been myself, so I was vastly astonished
when I looked up from the ledger to
see somebody sitting at the desk where I
myself had been writing a few moments
before. I felt quite upset for a moment,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
until I recognised the intruder. He was
nebulous, but I could see plainly enough who
it was."</p>

<p>"A member of your family in England?"
asked Duckford, who was a firm believer in
the good old-fashioned second sight of the
Scotch Highlanders. Barton answered in his
peculiarly quiet way.</p>

<p>"No, it was myself. The appearance of
seeing an image of one's self is not altogether
unusual, I believe. But, of course, such a
thing is really all nonsense ... a matter of
nerves."</p>

<p>"Now, I do not think it is fair of you to
put all such things down to nerves," said
Captain Crabbe, who had returned wounded
from France after being in the field since the
outbreak of the Great War. "If one cannot
always explain, one need not therefore ridicule."
Crabbe made this remark with a
gravity that was somewhat unusual with him.</p>

<p>"Bless my soul, boy, you haven't been
seeing the Angels of Mons or the Agincourt
Bowmen over there in Flanders, have you?"
asked Duckford, regarding Crabbe with a
keen eye, and scenting something savouring
of the mysterious, the super-natural. "Do
you believe in these stories? I mean&mdash;superstitions?"</p>

<p>Captain Crabbe shook his head. "Not
greatly," he said smiling. "But I am not
one of those who thoughtlessly laugh at that
which is out of the common, merely because<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
it cannot be explained on ordinary grounds.
Not since I have spent nearly twelve months
over in France, at any rate. Are you interested
in the weird?"</p>

<p>"I'd be a fool if I wasn't," said Duckford,
selecting a cigar from his case. "What's
your story about&mdash;I see you have one to
tell. I am not inquisitive as a rule; but,
somehow your manner has warned me that
you have something singularly interesting to
tell."</p>

<p>Crabbe remained silent a short time. Then,
looking at Duckford very earnestly, he answered:</p>

<p>"Well, perhaps I may tell you my story,
though I would not tell it to all these heretics
around me. Indeed, only two or three other
people have ever heard it. I hate&mdash;ah! more
than I can convey to any living soul&mdash;even
to think about it. But to you it may be of
special interest."</p>

<p>"You know that I look upon all such
things from the point of a simple, unbiassed inquirer,"
returned Duckford. "Come along,
Crabbe."</p>

<p>"A good cigar in front of the card room
fire, and your story, eh?" Duckford led the
way up to the snug card room where a cheerful
fire was blazing. "Sit down. Where is that
dashed waiter? Oh, you there, Griggs.
Come along with some whisky and soda."</p>

<p>Crabbe sat down in a deep chair by the fire,
and stretched his feet to the flame. Duckford<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
said nothing; only pulled at his cigar and
patiently waited for what he knew was soon
coming.</p>

<p>"Do you know&mdash;but, no, of course you
don't," he began presently. "But can you
imagine how it can be that a man could pass
all his force into a bronze statue and make it
live.... You've heard these literary men and
artists talk about putting their souls into their
work, Duckford?" Duckford pursed his lips.
"Everything lives&mdash;even a bronze statue,"
he said seriously. "If it was not so it would
atrophy, it would crumble and disappear.
Look at the case of&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's just what old Ombos said. And
if he didn't understand all about those things,
I should jolly well like to be led to the man
who did. Ombos told me hundreds of times
that a man walked about this earth throwing
his force into everything he came in contact
with&mdash;scattering some kind of power; and
of course that power is picked up by stones
and houses and ... statues, or anything.
Ombos misused it; that was disastrous. It
seems to me that it is safe to use this god-energy
only in its own proper sphere. You
have very likely heard of men who have tried
to pass themselves into inanimate objects?
Well, what would you say if I tell you that <i>I</i>
even <i>I</i>&mdash;who sit now so soberly before you,
whom before the war you knew to be ordinarily,
a quiet, peaceably-disposed, sport-loving
English fellow&mdash;had once been under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
the spell of a bronze statue that somebody
had passed clean into?"</p>

<p>"You were under the hypnotic influence
of your friend Ombos, probably," I suggested.</p>

<p>"You may think so, <i>now</i>; but you just
wait till I have told you all about Ombos,
and the bronze statue. Then you'll be able
to decide if it was trickery.... It would be
different if you could have seen the statue."</p>

<p>Then Crabbe proceeded to unfold his
strange tale.</p>

<p>"You know that when the war first broke
out I was attached to the Loamshires, and
we were one of the first British Regiments to
start for the land across the water. After
six months' fighting, during which every day
was crowded with enough incident to provide
a three-reel thriller for a cinema-man, I found
myself quartered at Ypres. Have you ever
been to Ypres? If you have, it will act as
a kind of antidote to those wretched picture
post-cards which show it in its last phase&mdash;a
heap of senseless wreckage. The 'Coal
Boxes,' 'Jack Johnsons' and other varied
presents from Krupp's had not fallen on the
town with such lavishness at the time my
regiment found shelter there. It was a June
afternoon when I first found my way there.
A mellow drowsiness hung over the Cloth
Hall and Cathedral. It was indeed a very
pleasant little town. The old houses of the
square, the Prior's Gate, the noble trees, the
stretch of green turf, all shared in the dream-like<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
repose. In the Rue Bar-le-Duc, as everybody
knows, just where it winds around to
the fine gateway of the Cathedral, there is a
row of little shops with bulging leaded windows,
dusty and delightful. The one that
took my eye was an antique shop. I had a
whole regiment of aunts and uncles at home
who in every letter demanded souvenirs, and
here was the chance to lodge a shipping
order, with about a hundred labels, and leave
the old antiquarian fogey to send 'em off.
It was inside that I met Ombos for the first
time. I selected the souvenirs, and wrote
labels; but old Ombos made a devil of a
muddle over sending them off, and a very
prim maiden aunt received a snuff box
adorned with a young French lady in very
scanty attire.... By the way, you don't
know my aunt Sylvia, do you?"</p>

<p>Crabbe laughed heartily for the first time
that evening.</p>

<p>"I spent some hours in the bulging window
of that old shop examining the wonderful
collection of beautiful old things, and staggering
about on piles of andirons and copper
warming pans, old Ombos watching me all
the time with an amused smile.</p>

<p>"I can still see Ombos standing like a
figure carved in old ivory, with one skinny
yellow hand resting on the edge of a black
oak table.</p>

<p>"'I call all this stuff here rubbish; not
worth looking at. But people do not understand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
real good stuff if I show it to 'em,' he
said, and smiled a remotely contemptuous
smile. 'Now if you really want to see some
choice antiques ...'</p>

<p>"He motioned me to follow, and taking a
lighted taper, led the way into a room at the
back of his shop. Ombos pottered about
with the taper on the end of a rod; suddenly
a big overhead chandelier burst into light
and I stood blinking in amazement.</p>

<p>"It was one of the most gorgeously furnished
oak-panelled rooms I have ever seen.
The floor was of black polished ebony, and
strewn on the floor were priceless leopard
skins and Persian rugs. There were heavy
Chinese tapestries worked in crimson and
gold, Tibetan devil-masks, gold candelabra,
armour richly inlaid with precious stones,
wondrous black oak furniture.... But I can
assure you, I could continue indefinitely
describing the contents of that room without
giving you any adequate idea of what it was
like!</p>

<p>"'Hardly what you expected to see, eh?'
Ombos said, and there was a faint trace of
mockery in his tone.</p>

<p>"I looked around me helplessly.</p>

<p>"'No!' I said, sinking into a most luxurious
silk-cushioned divan. 'Trenches, and
this! I suppose I'll wake up soon.'</p>

<p>"'Would you like to see my bronze statue
of Albert of Cologne? It's the gem of my
collection, and has a world-wide reputation!'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>"'It's rather different, you may say.' He
looked full over my head as I spoke, and
following the direction of his eyes, I turned.
In a dark recess in that part of the room
stood a bronze statue, some six feet in height.
It portrayed the great mystic in a long habit
fashioned after a monkish cowl, and his hair
and face reminded me of a bust of Nero I
had once seen in the gallery of the Louvre.
Ombos told me that the life of Albert Magnus
had been written by Dr. Sighart. This
Dominican, <i>magnus in magia</i>, <i>major in philosophia</i>,
<i>maximus in theologia</i>, was distinguished
alike for his knowledge of the black
art and his great virtue, for austerity of
regimen, and dislike of any form of society.
For other details of this philosopher I must
refer you to Sighart's excellent monograph
and Mr. James Mew's work on <i>The Black Art</i>
from which we learn that Albert of Cologne
was accused by the vulgar of holding illicit
commerce with the devil. They believed as
a matter of course that he was aided by
Beelzebub. And legends grew about him in
wild luxuriance. In particular he is credited
with the creation of an android, homunculus,
or, as some say, a fair maiden&mdash;an idea which
Goethe may have copied in his celebrated
play&mdash;able, according to some, to say only
'Salve,' but, according to others, to predict
with the unerring accuracy of a Zadkiel a
change of government, or the advent of a
pestilence, a royal marriage or a royal death.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
But all agree that this automaton was smashed
by his pupil Thomas Aquinas, who ought to
have known better than to believe it a device
of the Evil One. This story of the speaking
statue may go with those other marvels of
his vision of the Holy Virgin to encourage
him in theological study, and his stupendous
garden of flowers and birds and fountains in
mid-winter for William of Holland, and that
gracious scent which arose after a longer
time than four days out of his sacred sepulchre,
and his vision of St. Dominic, who himself
revealed to him the secret of the stone,
whereby he discharged all the debts of his
bishopric.</p>

<p>"These bald facts about our friend Magnus
must suffice. Old Ombos had a splendid
edition of his works, lately published in Paris
under the direction of a certain August
Borguet; twenty large folios on all imaginable
subjects. They included chapters on
hawks and adhering to God, on meteors and
the mystery of the Mass, on the healing of
the leper and the <i>eau de vie</i>.</p>

<p>"I was a gross Philistine in those days&mdash;still
am, as a matter of fact&mdash;and I could not
appreciate the statue. A strenuous life with
my Regiment had stifled what little appreciation
for such things a more leisured existence
might have fostered. I could not appreciate
nor understand the things that Ombos was
saying about the bronze statue and the
strange Master of the Masters it portrayed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>"Old Ombos&mdash;you could not help but
think that he had grown very much like the
statue himself; or had the statue grown like
him?&mdash;held up a candelabra which threw
the details of the bronze figure into relief and
cast flickering reflections on the dark oak
panelling of the recess.</p>

<p>"'It's an exquisite thing,' said Ombos.
'See how he rears himself on his black granite
plinth. A noble pile of mellow bronze,
irregular yet graceful.' Ombos regarded it
smilingly, yet with one of his queer, sinister
looks. It would have been hard to know
what he was thinking. He was one of those
tall, emaciated chaps, that make us men of
ordinary stature feel dwarfish; and as I
looked at his skull-like face I wondered at
first where his eyes were hidden ... they
seemed so far back in the dark hollows on
each side of his nose.</p>

<p>"I placed myself before Albert of Cologne&mdash;to
try and appreciate it, you know. Well, I
didn't think a great deal of it, but of course I
was a Philistine. I had seen many great,
heavy bronzes in the British Museum, and
they hadn't even stirred my heart, so it is
not surprising that this one failed to affect
me. I told Ombos, merely to please him, that
I thought it was an extraordinary piece of
work. But he very soon saw that I was
not able to appreciate old Magnus, and he
drew a heavy plush curtain back in front of
him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Come back! Come away!' he said.
'You have not yet the understanding. Oh,
it's big! It's a big god, I tell you.'</p>

<p>"Ombos was very patient with me, but as
he walked up and down the room kicking
the leopard skin rugs I knew he was thinking
what an idiot I was, and I just waited.</p>

<p>"'You have not yet the understanding,'
he muttered. 'It may come to you one
day ... the doors of life and death are left
ajar from time to time, and the light of Al
Tughrai's lamp of wisdom shines out upon
us for a moment between the opening and
closing.' The carved ivory face of old Ombos
seemed softer when he said that.</p>

<p>"'Did my brother care for the old bronze?
Did he love it as I do, every curve in the lean
and corded neck ...'</p>

<p>"And then all of a sudden he walked over
to me! 'Come!' he said, putting his hand
on my shoulder and speaking in a voice which
he had the trick of making wonderfully
amiable. 'Dear me, dear me! How I must
bore you with my old relics. You want some
tea and muffins or something of the kind, eh?
Will you do me the honour of taking tea
with me?' he said, leading me through a
door in a recess and a wilderness of corridors
to a small room, where a charming French
girl presided over a steaming tea-pot of
massive silver.</p>

<p>"'This is Captain Crabbe,' said Ombos
introducing me to her. He turned to me.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
'This is Margot, my niece,' he said with a
smile.</p>

<p>"I made a step forward and bowed slightly;
she was very pretty, this girl, as she stood
there with the rich red light from the silk
lamp shades behind her. She was one of
those dark, seductive women that look their
best in a warm light; and that evening her
face and figure seemed instinct with the joy
of youth.</p>

<p>"Never before have I tasted such hot-cakes
and sandwiches, and muffins ... there could
be nothing like them, nor any hot-cakes to
set above them in all Europe. The sinister
look had now quite passed from my host's
face as he sat before me stirring tea and
munching muffins comfortably; he seemed
goodheartedness embodied. On the table
were some wonderful lucid china bowls filled
with cigarettes, Parascho and <i>caporal ordinaire</i>,
Egyptian and every imaginable kind.
After tea we pushed back our chairs and
smoked. His conversation was delightful,
and showed me at once that he was a man of
brilliant gifts, yet an eccentric. I felt much
as Mark Twain must have felt when he first
met Rudyard Kipling; Twain has summed
up, in that inimitable way of his, the feeling
of being in the presence of an overwhelming
personality. 'I believed that he knew more
than any person I had met before, and I
knew that he knew that I knew less than any
person he had met before&mdash;though he did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
not say it, and I was not expecting that he
would.'... That was exactly how I felt when
I was talking tea with Ombos ... his conversation
was as exhilarating as wine; his
presence diffused a stimulating atmosphere;
I felt exalted by his joyous enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Well (to get on), after I left him at the
door of his old shop (which was such a dingy
entrance to all the luxury of the interior of
the place), and I think we were loth to part,
it was agreed between us that, should I
remain in the town, we were to meet again.
As I walked down the little <i>pav&eacute;</i> street something
I couldn't account for began to sweep
over me; it was not merely that the presence
of Ombos had fascinated me; there was
something else. There was something that
stirred in my heart&mdash;a thing which you will
not understand. If you had known Ombos
you might have understood. I wanted to go
back and have another look at that bronze
statue; I was becoming desperately afraid
that I had been too hasty in my inspection
of it&mdash;that I had under-estimated it. I was
very young, heedless, self-esteemed and smug,
and had hardly paused to pay a moment's
tribute to it. I felt that Albert of Cologne
was standing there, absorbed, proud, erect,
and defiant, waiting for me to find my <i>true</i>
eyes.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>"Of course, I did see the bronze statue<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
again, or I shouldn't be sitting here wasting
your time and patience. Within a few days
I went round again to the old shop, and old
Ombos was standing there amid his Queen
Anne candlesticks and piles of books just as
if he had been waiting for me.</p>

<p>"'Come in, come in!' he said, speaking
in a voice that made me feel honestly welcome.
'Dear me, dear me! I am very glad
you have not forgotten me.'</p>

<p>"'No,' I said. 'Not forgotten you or the
bronze statue. It was the only thing in your
place that did not interest me when I first
walked in.'</p>

<p>"I paused, and Ombos prompted me half
unconsciously: 'Yes?'</p>

<p>"'Now!' I said, meeting his eyes misting
my own in doing so, 'it is the only thing I
should like to see.'</p>

<p>"'Ah!' he said.... 'Well, I told you that
he might come over you slowly; but the gods
direct rightly whom they will. I tell you
that such things as the Keys of Mercy and
the Lamps of Wisdom are not gained in one
swift breath. What's gained in a few moments
is not worth having. All those who
have through toil and pain entered into
citizenship in the Celestial City will tell you
that. Gods do not grow in one night like
mushrooms. Every great masterpiece is an
evolution, be it a statue, a poem, a painting,
a man&mdash;or a god. If it is ever given to you
to see my Albert of Cologne as I see him you<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
will understand what I mean.' He turned
round to me and I gave a start, I can tell
you. Never have I seen such lurid gleams of
light as those that danced from those two
deep-set eyes! I say 'lurid,' for at times,
the colour of them took a blood red hue, and
changed quickly again to a glittering green.
As I stared at him&mdash;it was all over in a few
seconds&mdash;the baleful glare seemed to grow in
intensity, till I felt as though I were enduring
the mocking gaze of Albert of Cologne himself;
and verily, I half expected any moment
to see Ombos change into a mighty bronze
demon or some appalling, devilish shape from
the under-world.</p>

<p>"'Er&mdash;shall we go and have a look at the
statue?' I said, with a half-conscious determination
to see whether it really ever had
existed (I was beginning to think that Ombos
had been using a kind of hypnotic influence
on me, thus inducing me to see visions); and
also, as I believe, with some vague wish to
shut out the sight of those rolling, glittering
eyes. For the first time I felt towards him a
fierce anger, and I found myself making a
resolution never to return to see him again
when once I was free of the place.</p>

<p>"'Ah!' he said, 'I thought you'd want
to come back and see Albertus Magnus; I
want you to have a good look at him this
time and tell me if he looks quite as commonplace
as he did before. Such things can only
trickle slowly into the soul, but presently,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
ah! they get right hold of one&mdash;they permeate
one, and then there comes a time ...'</p>

<p>"Ombos snatched at the heavy curtain,
and the rings screeched on the brass rod.
Clothed in his monkish garb, his face furrowed
and seamed; the lustre of his eyes dimmed by
the tears of centuries&mdash;there stood Albertus.
The sunken cheeks spoke of years of study
and aspiration, but the swelling muscles of
his arms, the deep chest, the wonderful hands&mdash;big,
bony, horrible hands&mdash;spoke of one
from whom age has taken little toll. Here
was age, wisdom, mysticalness, a subtle sense
of pensive melancholy, and a persistence that
never tires.</p>

<p>"'Well, how do you like my statue this
time?' asked Ombos.</p>

<p>"'Splendid!' I breathed.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' he said looking hard at me. 'The
best of it is Albertus asks for nothing. You
can neither bribe nor buy him; your flattery
will not move him; your approbation or
blame alike are vain ... he has the self-sufficiency
of the Master of Masters.'</p>

<p>"'Yes,' I found myself saying eagerly.
'He is the Master of Masters.'</p>

<p>"Suddenly he turned and threw the curtain
back and took me by the arm and led me
away. 'My force is all going into Albertus&mdash;but
I must not overdo it. If I stand too long
before him he drains me of all my god-energy,
you know ... that leaves me sick and exhausted.
You've heard about how Michael<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
Angelo put all his power into his marble
statue of Moses? You've read about such
things? You know the kind of gush. I
met a poor, half-crazed, devil-driven poet-fellow
in Paris some years ago who told me
he had written a great poem; he had lured
the crucified soul of a murderer into his
verses. Confoundedly conceited about it,
too, he was ... called it <i>The Ballad of Reading
Gaol</i>. Bah! It would have taken him a
lifetime to put a murderer's socks into a
poem. He was a mountebank ... a posturer!
And what is this winged thing men name the
soul? And who did make the stars?'
Ombos turned demon-like eyes on me, and
his whole face seemed lit up with an appalling
mirth.</p>

<p>"'Believe them not, for they are not
miraculous ones. They will be lost for ever;
they will die. Their books and statues may
live, but they will die, as sure as the grass
grows over graves. My force and body and
soul is passing into the Master of Masters....
I shall live and be a god, I shall stand oblivious
and indifferent to the centuries as they
stalk by.'</p>

<p>"'You don't mean to tell me ...'</p>

<p>"Ombos looked up, his red-green eyes
gleaming as he answered,</p>

<p>"'Most certainly I do ... my soul will pass
into that bronze statue when I am ready to
give it up.'</p>

<p>"'The war, Mr. Ombos,' I thought as I<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
looked at his shrivelled fearsome figure, 'has
turned your head. There are certainly a
few bats in your belfry. You will find your
way into an asylum before many weeks have
passed.'</p>

<p>"You must understand, I didn't realize
what kind of a chap I was dealing with then,
I didn't know that he was all cold and calm
and apart from life ... very clever and&mdash;philosophical,
<i>but not human</i>.</p>

<p>"'Nonsense! How can a man's soul pass
into a bronze statue?' I asked rather testily.
'Good heavens, man, do you realize that
you're trying to make me believe that which
is beyond the pale of all human possibility!'</p>

<p>"'Human possibility! What is human
possibility? I tell you that all this is fact;
simply.' Ombos rose and began to pace to
and fro over the Persian rugs like a tiger.
'I'm not given to imagining things.'</p>

<p>"'Bah!' he grunted. 'Every child will
tell you that the tendency of spirits to return
to the old haunts of bodily life is almost
universal. The universal laws apply ...
there is no escape from the great law, the
attraction of environment.'</p>

<p>"'The rest is merely every-day knowledge.
Have you ever heard of ancient formula by
which the grosser factors of the body may be
eliminated, leaving the ethereal portions to
retain the spirit? Do you not understand
that the body may be preserved from absolute
disintegration? The old alchemists all knew<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
that death could be indefinitely deferred in
this way. Professor Vaini left among his
papers a work of two thousand pages in which
he clearly demonstrated that it was possible
for a spiritualized body to retain a modified
life practically for ever. Any doctor will tell
you the hair and nails of a dead person will
often grow for years after....'</p>

<p>"Ombos turned his glittering eyes on me
a moment inquisitively.</p>

<p>"'Oh, tell me all that kind of stuff if you
like,' I protested good-humouredly. 'It
makes no impression on me. I'm a normal
man, Ombos, and I object to having my free
imagination harrowed over things that don't
count. Behind that curtain is a bronze statue,
and it never can or will be anything else
but a bronze statue, and that's about the
sum and total of it all.'</p>

<p>"'I was merely telling you a few cold and
scientific facts,' returned Ombos argumentatively.</p>

<p>"'Now, if I wished to impress you it would
be easy enough. I would like to test that
sensitiveness which you boast that you don't
possess. I think I could give you a severe
shaking-up! And I will begin by telling you
that I will employ mere vulgar trickery ...
the trickery of any mountebank who fools
people at a country fair!'</p>

<p>"He looked at me with that slow smile of
his&mdash;the smile of the mystic&mdash;mocking, mysterious.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span></p>

<p>"I answered him with a weak laugh.
'You may try some of your tricks, wizard;
but you will fail to impress me, I think!'</p>

<p>"'I make it a habit not to fail.'</p>

<p>"His keen eyes flamed, and his brow was
dark and hot. He started up and walked
over to the small oak escritoire. Bending
down he produced a small glass lamp, and
put a light to it. It burnt with the imperceptible
flame of pure spirit of wine. He
took it and vanished a moment. When he
returned, and set it before me, it gave out a
keen white glare and heavily-scented smoke.
He took me by the arm and pointed to the
black velvet curtain which hid the bronze
statue. 'See, there: behind&mdash;through the
curtain. Who is that?'</p>

<p>"While I looked, Ombos gave a strange
rasping sound. Then, in a tone of weird
intensity: 'See! See!' and he laid his
hand on mine ... the curtain was no longer
there, and some vague thing gathered&mdash;the
statue was dim behind it&mdash;the form of a
man.</p>

<p>"'The veil is drawn,' said the voice of
Ombos. 'Master, the veil is drawn. See, if
you will. See!'</p>

<p>"In a fluid light the form darkened. I
saw Ombos seated before a table with his
head bowed down over a folio volume, quiet
and still. The head was ill to look at, and I
knew he was dead.... All grew misty and
faded into light again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>"'The veil is drawn,' he droned. 'Look
again!'</p>

<p>"Again a film gathered in the light and I
saw the Albertus Magnus for a moment. Then
it changed to Ombos, himself.... A lean
and grim form with dim mocking features, and
yellow eyes that glittered and flickered....</p>

<p>"And again the vision blurred and faded
into light. Then Ombos dashed the lamp
aside, and the room was in red darkness ...
the silence and darkness seemed to endure
for an eternity. I heard the hiss of a quick
indrawn breath at last ... it was my own
breathing.... I opened my eyes.</p>

<p>"I was in the small room where I had
taken tea with Ombos and Margot some weeks
before. Supper was laid on a superb octagon
table. 'They were good tricks, were they
not?' said Ombos, with an easy laugh. His
keen eyes smote keen into mine. 'Now you
will in truth be able to go away and tell
people how I tricked you, how it was plainly
all a cheat.'</p>

<p>"At that moment Margot came in with a
big apron tied about her. She greeted me
pleasantly, setting a tray down on the table.</p>

<p>"'We do our own work here, Captain
Crabbe,' she said. 'Do you want to make yourself
useful?'</p>

<p>"I rose promptly. My little adventure
into the occult world with Ombos had been
rather exhilarating. I was glad when she
told me to follow her out, through a long<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
corridor into the kitchen, where she gave me
a can-opener and a tin of sardines.</p>

<p>"'Open those up and turn them into this
little dish, please. And if you have any
hygienic aversion to tinned things, please
forget it. Otherwise you will have to eat
some of my hot teacakes.'</p>

<p>"Margot was standing at the table, cleaning
a crisp head of celery. The position showed
me her profile, with a little wisp of black hair
escaping near one ear.</p>

<p>"We sat down to one of the most cheerful
meals three people have ever enjoyed. We
sat chatting there for nearly an hour. All
the while I was trying to reconcile this man
Ombos who sat talking boyishly with the
student of occultism and black magic I had
talked with an hour or so before. If I had
felt any resentment of the tricks he had
played on me it would have vanished utterly.
Afterwards Margot made real Turkish coffee
over a dainty spirit lamp ... once&mdash;in a
critical stage in the coffee-making, too&mdash;she
looked up and her eyes sought mine; then
her red lips parted in a smile. She poured
out the coffee deftly, blowing out the lamp,
and put the little copper pot on a plate.</p>

<p>"Ombos surveyed his coffee with the air
of a connoisseur, his head turned on one
side.</p>

<p>"Margot produced the bowls of cigarettes
and reached over my shoulder to offer me
one. 'You want Egyptian?' she said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
smiling. 'You see I have a good memory&mdash;you
smoked them last time.'</p>

<p>"A warm faint perfume came from her
hair.</p>

<p>"It was ten o'clock when I rose to leave,
Ombos and Margot came out to the front
to say good night: my last glimpse, as I
walked down the <i>pav&eacute;</i> street, was of Margot&mdash;a
bare-headed figure, with wistful grey eyes,
calm with the mysterious wisdom of pure
womanhood. She waved her dainty lace
handkerchief to me.</p>

<p>"That was the last of Ombos in the flesh.
The next day, after German shells had poured
on Ypres for six hours without cessation, my
regiment left the town, and we went out a
mile or two to take over some trenches.</p>

<p>"A month later my duty took me back to
Ypres, and I found myself walking up the
Rue Bar-le-Duc towards the little antique
shop. Overhead the shells whistled without
cessation. It was now a city of the dead&mdash;one
could not realize that it was the same pleasant
little town where I had met with so strange
an experience a few weeks back. Men,
children and horses were lying dead in every
gutter.</p>

<p>"In due course I arrived at the shop. A
large hole had been ripped in the <i>pav&eacute;</i> road
before the door, and I had to step over a
dead and twisted soldier to gain an entrance.
Of course the place was empty. Ombos,
Albertus Magnus and all the wonderful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
contents of the spacious old rooms had disappeared.
I made a search of the house,
and it was not without a curious sensation
in my heart that I entered the room where
the Master of Masters had towered in his
niche. Silence&mdash;only the faint boom of a
gun far away in the French trenches&mdash;awful,
ghastly silence. Then a deafening roar and
a falling of masonry as Krupp's marked down
another house in the town of sorrow. The
horror of it!</p>

<p>"I turned dismally away, out into the
Rue Bar-le-Duc, and along the square. A
few scattered lights shone feebly through the
evening mist, and over towards the Norman
bridge the yellow flames from a burning house
lit up the sky with a lurid glow. At nearly
every street corner little groups of civilians
had collected and were talking and gesticulating
in a terrified manner. When a big
shell came with a hoarse, rattling noise
through the air, like a racing motor cycle
on the track at Brooklands, they would rush
into their homes, panic-smitten. If death
winked, and passed them over, out they would
creep again. And so they lived in an inferno
of shells for weeks on end.</p>

<p>"An ambulance wagon overturned in the
middle of the road attracted my attention.
I could not repress a shudder as I looked on
the shell-shattered wreck.... It was the
old type of four-horse ambulance used by
the army in South Africa; possibly it had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
jolted into the shell-swept death-trap of
Spion Kop, or carried men into the reeking
enteric camps of Ladysmith. Well, it had
made its last journey this time! The four
dead horses had not been cut away from the
traces, and from underneath the huddled and
twisted heap stuck out an arm, and in the
hand was clutched one of those short, stumpy
whips which are used by the lead driver of a
gun. I can see that poor chap in my mind
thrashing and urging his team of horses into
a gallop, for it was not reckoned wise to
meander about the streets of Ypres, and then&mdash;one
blinding crash.</p>

<p>"I swung round with a great desire to get
away from the appalling scene, and as I did so,
I noticed a girl in a doorway struggling in the
grip of a powerful, swarthy-faced man of
middle age. In the fading light I caught a
glimpse of her face, and I was out of the shadow
and by her side like a sky-rocket.</p>

<p>"'Let her go!' I said shortly. 'Before
I mop out the gutter with you.'</p>

<p>"The man turned on me.</p>

<p>"'Who the devil&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'That's enough!'</p>

<p>"A Red Cap&mdash;a corporal in the Military
Police&mdash;loomed into view, and with an imprecation
the rough backed away from the
girl, turned, and in a moment was lost in the
gloom. I brought my eyes back to the girl
who had confronted me in the red light of
sunset, and I stood gazing at her dumbly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
fascinated, but with never a word to say.
She was burning with anger and shame,
trembling like an aspen, too.</p>

<p>"<i>It was Margot!</i></p>

<p>"The girl glanced up at me, a look that
set my heart throbbing. It was my first
real sight of her since I had seen her that
afternoon with Ombos. I had thought her
pretty then, but there is a distinct gap between
a pretty woman and a lovely woman, and
she was as beautiful as a Greek marble.
Indeed, but for the carmine of her lips, and
long dark eyelashes, she might have been
chiselled out of pellucid stone, for her skin
was dead white. She was&mdash;or had been&mdash;beautifully
and expensively dressed, and
there was breeding and refinement in every
line of her face.</p>

<p>"'Don't you know me?' I said.</p>

<p>"The girl looked at me intently.</p>

<p>"'I know you, of course,' she said.</p>

<p>"I won't waste time in trying to tell you
what my thoughts and sensations were.
Rather I will tell you instead, what I did.</p>

<p>"It was some minutes later, and already
we had started to walk slowly back in the
direction of the Rue Bar-le-Duc.</p>

<p>"'And now you want to know&mdash;' she said.</p>

<p>"'Yes&mdash;that's it&mdash;what's become of Ombos
... and the bronze statue?'</p>

<p>"Margot looked up at me, and a strange
melancholy transformed her face.... She
was at a loss for words.... 'Poor Ombos&mdash;oh,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
poor, cranky Ombos,' she muttered.
'One morning I found him dead in his room,
with all his wonderful, brown, powdery-looking
books. He was leaning on a table
over an old volume that he was fond of....
And then the doctors came. He had died,
they afterwards said, of failure of the heart's
action.'</p>

<p>"'Dead,' I murmured mechanically....</p>

<p>"'Then everything was very uncomfortable.
But I saved a good sum of money,
and I sent most of the valuable things to
Paris to be sold&mdash;no living soul coming forward
to make any claims. Ombos left
everything to me ... bonds, securities, and
all. Come this way&mdash;I have a little room
up the side-street.</p>

<p>"'He left me well provided for. He&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'Yes; but why on earth do you stay in
this dead city,' I broke in.</p>

<p>"'Sssh!... Don't interrupt unless I ask
you questions.</p>

<p>"'I'll tell you all about everything. It's
extraordinarily difficult....'</p>

<p>"I waited.</p>

<p>"'You see,' she picked her words carefully,
'Ombos was so&mdash;queer about that horrible
Albertus Magnus of his. He had made me
promise never to part with it and it seemed
to me&mdash;stupidly perhaps&mdash;that I owed him
that&mdash;to see that his only wish was carried
out to the letter. Otherwise I should never
dare to have stayed here. You couldn't<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
expect me to move about with a gigantic bronze
figure without making ample preparations.'</p>

<p>"'Ah!'...</p>

<p>"'This is where I live,' she said in a low
voice.</p>

<p>"Margot had halted in front of an alley
leading over rough cobbles, into a small
square of what appeared to be old oak-fronted
houses. A narrow passage-way ran down
by one side of the end house.</p>

<p>"'Won't you come inside, and&mdash;see Albertus?
This way,' she said. 'It's rather dark,
I'm afraid.'</p>

<p>"In pitch-black darkness, guided by Margot's
hand, I stumbled through a doorway into
a spacious hall&mdash;a mysterious, fusty-smelling
cavern of a place&mdash;along a passage, and then
up a flight of worn stone stairs. It was one
of those old houses where one could feel the
silence and hear the shadows. The steps
came out upon a bare landing with oak-lined
walls, lit only by a solitary flickering candle,
and Margot, halting before a locked door,
opened it and motioned me to enter.</p>

<p>"The room was in darkness, and I knew not
what fear, akin to that little grey shadow of a
fear, was to be found in the darkness there.
At first I hesitated. Then Margot came with
the candle, and as it guttered, the flame
threw distorted shadows; at one moment
lighting up a dark spot with a sudden flash,
and then sending queer, erratic reflections
chasing across the oak panelling. Then a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
flicker displayed the unmade bed on which
Margot had lain.... She coloured deeply.</p>

<p>"'You have stored the bronze statue in
some other part of the house,' I said at a
venture.</p>

<p>"She looked at me, as I thought, a little
uneasily.</p>

<p>"'You aren't afraid of that old statue?'
she exclaimed. 'We might at least light up
the candles,' she added, as I made no reply;
and she turned and put a burning taper to
the candelabra.</p>

<p>"As Margot spoke the candles flared up,
and then, with a sudden start of unexplained
dismay, I saw in a corner by the bed stood
the bronze figure.</p>

<p>"As I looked at it I felt the horror of nightmare
seize me, for it bore a striking resemblance
to Ombos. A dreadful exuberance and
vitality seemed to shine through the thing,
an exuberance wholly malign, a vitality that
foamed and frothed with unimaginable evil.
Evil beamed from the deep cavernous eyes;
it leered in the demon-like mouth....
Ugh!&mdash;</p>

<p>"Margot walked up to me and patted my
shoulder. 'Well, and are you really afraid
of that thing,' she said, pointing to the
statue.</p>

<p>"'But, don't you see?' said I. 'It's
scarcely the face of a bronze figure. It's
almost human. No; it isn't even human.
It's the face of some devil.' Margot laughed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Yes: he isn't very cheerful,' she said.
'Scarcely a boudoir ornament, eh? I'll throw
a blanket over Albertus if you like.'</p>

<p>"'I really wish you would,' I said, 'I
don't care so long as he can't grin at me.'</p>

<p>"Somehow, with the bronze figure covered
up, I felt much lighter and happier.</p>

<p>"I think that Margot&mdash;that Margot must
have been rather overstrained after the
struggle with that brute. She seemed to be
all nerves&mdash;upset: insisted in putting her
little white hand on mine in a very solemn
way, and thanking me for all sorts of imaginary
favours.... Got 'a wheeze' into her
head, among other rot, that I had saved her
life.</p>

<p>"'Look here,' I said. 'I wish you
wouldn't talk so jolly silly. I'm not a bit
unselfish, I'm a novelist. There was nothin'
doin' with my crowd&mdash;regiment I mean&mdash;and
so I came here to look for "copy." That
was why I persisted in seeing you home here.
It was all just a matter of "copy" to me&mdash;at
the start.' I paused, and Margot turned her
tourmaline eyes full on me. Had you asked
me after my first visit to old Ombos what
Margot's eyes were like I could not have told
you the colour to save my life. If I had been
forced to weigh out a guess I might have
said they were a shade of grey. Grey?
Name of a little dog! Yes, I should have
called 'em grey, but that would have been
like describing the Pyramids by saying they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
were stone. However can I describe the
wonder that I found ..."</p>

<p>A sort of flush appeared on Crabbe's boyish
face. "I&mdash;I'm afraid I have run off the
track of my story a bit," he stammered, "but
I may as well tell you all of it."</p>

<p>"Take a drink of whiskey;" said Duckford
slowly, "and take your own time."</p>

<p>"Margot looked at me, her lips quivering.
'You've not found much "copy" I'm afraid,'
she answered despondently.</p>

<p>"'Now,' I said, meeting her eyes, '"copy"
matters not at all ... you are all that
matters.'</p>

<p>"It does not in the least concern you or
the story to know what manner of a woman
Margot is. But I might say that she is in
fulness a woman&mdash;not a fribble, or one of
those pick-me-up-and-carry-me women. So
when I said plain words to her she did not
pretend to misunderstand.</p>

<p>"'Don't let us be conventional,' I went
on, 'It wouldn't fit in with these wonderful
days a bit. Perhaps I've no right to talk
to you like this&mdash;but Ombos is dead and you
seem to have no friend in the world. We
have got caught up, you and I, in one of the
marvellous tangles of this great conflict, and
God knows how it's all going to end. But it
seems to have been written in the book of
fate that we should meet, and whether Ombos
and his bronze statue haunts me to the end
of my days or he doesn't, I'm glad I have met<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
you, and to know for just one swift hour
I've used these hands of mine in your service.
I wouldn't take back one minute of these
great days!'</p>

<p>"Margot was regarding me with her wide
eyes, a little startled, but I saw beyond those
rounds of tourmaline a soft light.</p>

<p>"'How is it?' said Margot calmly. 'A
few hours ago you hadn't spoken more than
a few words to me ... you don't know
me.'</p>

<p>"'In times of war,' I reminded her, 'we
live a year in a day.'</p>

<p>"Margot rested her chin on her hands.
'What a strange world it is,' she murmured.</p>

<p>"'Confoundedly strange,' I agreed. 'I
can't help thinking even now that my meeting
with Ombos in that weird den in the Rue
Bar-le-Duc was all a dream, and I'm going
to wake up soon.'</p>

<p>"'I didn't mean that,' Margot said quietly.
'That didn't seem so strange to me. Perhaps
it's because I lived with Ombos for nearly four
years.'</p>

<p>"'It was just like a page torn from the
<i>Arabian Nights</i> to me,' I said. She smiled
at me wanly.</p>

<p>"'The only other home I've known was
with foster-parents in Paris when I was quite
a child,' she said. 'I was brought here
straight from a convent school in Brussels.
Ombos was my guardian. He'&mdash;she hesitated,
shivering&mdash;'I don't think he was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
quite&mdash;sane, but he was always very kind
to me.'</p>

<p>"'Margot,' I stammered as I imprisoned
her hands in mine, 'I'm going to take you
out of this mudhole of a place.... I'm
going to send you over to England. I'll stay
here and look after you to-night, and to-morrow
I'll see you on your way.'</p>

<p>"She dragged her hands away suddenly.</p>

<p>"'But are you <i>sure</i>?' Margot said, half
sobbing. 'Please reflect ... you are in too
much of a hurry. When an idea comes to
you&mdash;the idea, that you want me for instance&mdash;what
do you do? Instead of taking the
idea for a long, cool walk, you sit down here
to work it up ... it is the eternal boyishness
of the Englishman. You must first think of
your future.'</p>

<p>"'But do you think that the future holds
anything for me now that I wouldn't throw
away with both hands for you?' I said, and
the passion of my voice whipped the blood
up into that alabaster face ... she put out
her hands with a little pleading movement.</p>

<p>"'Don't,' she said again.</p>

<p>"'I must,' I said stubbornly. 'There's
nothing in the world powerful enough to take
you from me ... if you will have me. Margot,
you must believe me ... you shall believe me!'
I added almost savagely, and my hands
closed round her waist as she leaned against
the back of a huge old divan. Margot closed
her eyes for a moment and her head dropped<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
gently on my shoulder. Her hair brushed
my face, and the faint musky scent that
came from it is woven into all my after
memories of that moment, I drew her closer
and she sighed for very happiness, while life
drifted past in uncounted minutes or hours.</p>

<p>"It was the next evening that I arranged
to have one of the A.S.C. cars,&mdash;then running
between Ypres and St. Omer,&mdash;wait for us
outside Margot's rooms. Under cover of
darkness I bundled Margot into the motor-lorry,
got the bronze statue in, and jumped up
on the driver's seat beside her, and sank down
with a gasp of relief. One last glimpse of
the little bulgy window of the shop as the
lorry rounded the corner, and then I turned
and looked at the girl. Tears glittered in
her eyes, and her lips were quivering. I put
my hand out and closed over her ice-cold
fingers.</p>

<p>"'Margot!' I said, 'I'm taking you to
Boulogne and then you will go to England
to my home. My people will look after
you....'</p>

<p>"'But&mdash;' she hesitated.</p>

<p>"'There are no "buts,"' I said firmly,
'You are coming with me. You can't stay in
this infernal hole, like a rat in a trap.'</p>

<p>"Margot gave a weary little sigh and
leaned closer to me, giving herself into my
care as trustfully as a child. Until that time
she had been just a figure in the great war
game that might provide me with something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
to 'write up' into a book. That had been
my principal thought. Now, all in a few
moments, her beauty, the frightened look
which had shone in her great grey eyes, her
distress made me forget all that, drove all
thoughts of traffic with publishers from my
mind. I knew only that it was good to help
her.</p>

<p>"Then I set about thinking how I could get
Margot and Albertus Magnus to England.
It was going to be a difficult game. I went
carefully over all the good fellows I knew
who could help me. There was old Longden
of the A.S.C. dep&ocirc;t at St. Omer, there was
Captain Chester, the transport officer at
Boulogne, and Orgles of ammunition supply
at Cassel, which is a small place where the
strings of motors from the base unload.</p>

<p>"Well, (to get on,) we arrived late that night
at St. Omer, and by a vast amount of bribery
and cajolery I got some A.S.C. men to knock
up a strong case for the Albertus Magnus and&mdash;but
enough. It is sufficient to say that
an officer who was going home on leave was
kind enough to see Margot as far as Boulogne,
and in the fullness of time both
Albertus Magnus and the girl came safely to
England.</p>

<p>"I have endeavoured to give you the
facts of my strange story up to this point,
without omission or exaggeration. I have
been careful not to miss out the slightest
items. If I have failed, it must not be put<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
down to forgetfulness: for I do not think
there is a single thing about old Ombos that
has not been permanently fixed in my mind.
Even now I have but to shut my eyes to see
the leering face of Albertus, to stand once
more trembling with terror and see that
green shadow jump into the dusk with hellish
glee and frolicsome skippings and toppings
gallop away, to walk into the old library at
home and see poor Price with his knees
drawn up and eyes fixed open in extreme
terror&mdash;But enough. I do not exaggerate.</p>

<p>"And now I must come to what you'll call
the second part of the story&mdash;though it was
all one long connected nightmare to me. I
returned from France, as you know, six
months ago, with a bullet in my leg, and
thought myself in the best of luck to get a
'blighty' one; I mean a slight wound which
necessitated me being sent back to England.
I went down to a charming old house at
Monk's Ely which my father had lately
moved into, and soon drifted into peaceful
ways of country life. The trivial little
objects and customs of rustic life&mdash;those
simple things that are best of all&mdash;attracted
me surprisingly.</p>

<p>"A delightful room full of my books and
pictures had been prepared on the ground
floor of the house, but I was not often in it.
Still, I accorded to my bronze statue a
prominent corner in the room, where he
frowned upon all my other possessions with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
that great look of disinterestedness which
only bronze or death can typify.</p>

<p>"A week or two passed without incident,
except that again and again a curious feeling
that sometimes I was not <i>alone</i> was present
in my mind. In a way I got used to it,
because after being in the trenches and
looking in the face of death as a kind of
hobby the feeling of release and lightness
that comes over one drives all other troubles
clean away. But after a while this feeling
seemed to be growing in poignancy. In fact
at the end of the first fortnight I mentioned
it to my father.</p>

<p>"'Strange you should have felt like that,'
he said one night after dinner, 'because for
the last day or so, the same sensation has
been creeping over me. When is it that you
have your ghostly visitor? Have you any
feeling now of such a thing, for instance?'</p>

<p>"We were having a smoke on the lawn ...
it was a beautiful evening of stars, and as he
spoke I felt the unseen presence with terrific
intensity. At that moment the door that
led from the library quietly swung open, and
just as quietly closed again, as if someone
had passed out into the garden.</p>

<p>"'Did you see that?' I said. 'There is
not a breath of wind stirring: odd thing that
a door should play those kind of tricks.'</p>

<p>"My father was silent a moment.</p>

<p>"'You felt it then,' he said.</p>

<p>"'Frightfully!' I breathed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Let's get back to the dining-room,' my
father urged.</p>

<p>"Just as we got up to the house door (not
the library door which opened on the path),
I saw, as I thought, a figure move in the
bushes near the library. Perhaps it would
be better to describe it as a shadow ... but
I could swear that it was of a greenish colour.
For one moment, from sheer terror of the
unseen, I stood frozen to the doorstep, and
then my father touched my arm and we
walked in together.</p>

<p>"That evening, my friend Price, after his
wont, dropped in. I had just run the car
round to the front door and was about to
run into the village to bring the vicar back
to stay with us over the week-end&mdash;besides
I badly wanted to get away from those
infernal gusts of depression that swept the
place. I did not scruple to keep to my
arrangements and told Price to make himself
comfortable in the library till my return.
'You'll find cigars, spirits&mdash;and <i>the</i> spirit,'
I said jokingly. He nodded and laughed,
and I jumped into the car, and quickly put a
mile between myself and&mdash;the bronze statue,
for I was convinced that Albertus of Cologne
was connected in some unearthly way with
the face of Fear that often turned full on me.</p>

<p>"A half-hour afterwards I had pulled up at
the vicarage, and was hanging on to the bell
which gave forth a mighty clamour. I was
impatient to get inside for a moment and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
behold the good genial face of the vicar.
Somehow, wherever the vicar went, he had a
wonderful way of cheering things up; his
presence diffused an atmosphere of merriment.
The door suddenly opened and I was
face to face with him:</p>

<p>"'My dear boy,' cried the vicar, 'I am
glad to see you.'</p>

<p>"Then he stared at me in amazement.
'What have you done to yourself? You
have aged years since I saw you last week.'</p>

<p>"'Ah, I have things to tell you,' I said,
'Things that will make you think I am off
my head, but I shall convince you&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"The vicar took my arm and walked me
up to his sanctum, a fine spacious chamber,
beautified with that simplicity which throws a
wonderful dignity over all, and tends to show
how in omission so much more refinement is
to be discovered than in ornament. Touches
of the vicar's keen discernment of those
things which are worthy and noble were
revealed on every hand&mdash;knowledge of this
sort is older than ten thousand years. The
room received one like a friend. The alcoves
were filled with well-bound books, there was
a superb Persian carpet, old gate-legged
tables&mdash;oak was there everywhere; in the
beams and the shelves and the mighty writing
desk. The servant had brought in a small
table with syphons and spirits, and had set
a lamp upon it. 'Help yourself,' said the
vicar.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"I poured out a dose of whisky and was
lifting it for a squirt of soda when all at once
I saw Fear; not apprehension, not foreboding,
but FEAR&mdash;the glass fell from my hand and
my fingers sagged on the handle of the syphon.
I saw my reflection in a long glass, and my
face was bleached to an unhealthy dull
whiteness.</p>

<p>"Suddenly like a shot, right in the middle
of things, I found myself wondering about
poor Price. And I wasn't only wondering
somehow I was horribly uneasy about him.
It came to me that I had been heartless to leave
him all alone with the statue. At last I
couldn't stand the strain any longer. I
got up.</p>

<p>"'Vicar,' I said, 'I'm going back to see if
Price is all right. It will sound quite mad
to you, I expect, but if you want to know the
sober truth, I will tell you that I have just
seen him in a vision: he was in trouble,
I know. But come, let us get into the car.
I have never told anyone my whole story
yet, but I shall like to tell you about Ombos
and his statue. I will tell you on the way
back to Abbot's Ely. It is about time, in
fact, that I tried to classify what I have
learned.'</p>

<p>"I then briefly related the story of Ombos
and our acquaintance. I concealed nothing,
dwelling on the irresistible alluring influence
of the bronze statue. I described the depression,
the despair, the overpowering moral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
weakness which seemed to follow me since the
Albertus Magnus had become one of my
possessions. In short, I lifted the curtain,
for the first time, and showed the vicar a
true picture of the strange world I had moved
in for the last few weeks.</p>

<p>"When we had returned and backed the
car into the coach house we walked across
the lawn to the back door. Here we met
Clayton, the butler. He appeared to be
frightened, and told me that he had heard a
kind of quivering, sobbing voice coming from
the library. He thought Mr. Price was ill.
We went to the door. It was locked, and an
application of a spare key proved that the
other key had been left in the lock inside.
We knocked loudly, and called. There was
no reply. Clayton's conviction that 'something
had happened' worked on my nerves
frightfully, and in the end the vicar and I
forced open the door with some gardening
tools.</p>

<p>"Something <i>had</i> happened.</p>

<p>"The room was in complete darkness,
and at first nothing could be discerned at
all. A slight wind had got up in the last
half an hour; and it rustled the trailers of
ivy against the opened windows. The heavy
curtains moved carelessly in the draught,
and the trees creaked faintly. But beyond
these inevitable noises, the room was quiet.
Then gradually, the outline of the room became
visible and the framework of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
window began to shape itself dimly before
my eyes. In the hazy light from the glass
doors, and the vague light of a lamp in the
hall, I saw that the chesterfield in the window
bay where Price so often lounged was tenanted.
A gleam of his light tweed suit showed there
and across that.... Oh, I fully expected
to see the other thing! Across that there
was an obscure greenish shadow.</p>

<p>"I walked towards it, when suddenly the
shadow shot upwards and was lost to sight.
Then the springs of the chesterfield creaked
and wheezed, the same as they will when
suddenly released from pressure. Clayton
came in at that moment holding a candelabra
aloft and the feeble flames disclosed poor old
Price. He was on his back, his knees slightly
drawn up. The face was not the face of a
man at all&mdash;it was a horrible mask of contorted
terror. His eyes were opened and
fixed; the mouth was twisted in a gape of
fearful wonder.</p>

<p>"'Run, Clayton,' said I; 'a doctor and a
policeman!' Clayton placed the candelabra
on the table and bounced out and down the
front steps.</p>

<p>"Price was dead without a doubt. He had
been strangled, the doctor thought from the
greenish-black marks on his neck and other
circumstances. The savage deed had been
accomplished with frightful ferociousness and
strength. Soon the room was in the possession
of the police, and the vicar and I turned out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
There was little evidence at the inquest.
The cries of poor Price had been heard by
my man, the body had been found&mdash;that
was the practical summing-up of the whole
matter. The doctor gave his evidence as
to the probability of murder, and the police
evidence tended in the same direction. It
was affirmed that (some would say) he had
been baffled by Price in an attempt to rob
the house, had sacrificed the poor fellow to
the fury of his checked greed, and had afterwards
escaped by the window. The jury
found that Price had died by the hand of
some person unknown.</p>

<p>"'Well, vicar,' I asked afterwards, 'what
do you think of the verdict?'</p>

<p>"He told me that from <i>his</i> point of view it
seemed to be the most reasonable one that
could be given; and to agree with the laws
of common-sense.</p>

<p>"'Yes,' I replied, 'perhaps you are right
from the common-sense point of view. Nevertheless,
I know that Price did not die by any
human agency. It is too ghastly; I can
still see that green shadow hovering above
his body on the couch. The huge shadow,
the Elemental, the spirit of Ombos&mdash;whatever
you like to call it&mdash;was there in that room
with Price. It was there in a form that could
be seen and felt. It is something more
substantial than an ordinary shadow ...
it is a thing of hellish terror, and it comes
from that infernal bronze statue.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thence forward, as day followed day,
the ghastly memory of the murder of Price
seemed to recede from my mind. I neither
heard nor saw anything, nor did that sense
of the unseen presence lurking about the
house, come to me. I was beginning to hope
that the spell of the bronze statue had passed
away for good. But one night after this
interval I again felt fear looking whitely on
me again. If I were to describe all the
incidents of the next few days in their order
my story would never come to an end, and
your patience would be exhausted. Wherever
I went after dark had fallen the shadow of
the unseen followed me. I had a passion
for inviting people to stay with me, and I
longed for companionship of my kind which
I had never known before; I was eager
to throw myself into the realities of life. The
sense of a certain kind of separateness is
hell! Just you ask anybody who knows. I
called on people, lived in my car, and dined
out on the slightest provocation. I remember
I spent one evening, (after my
desperate efforts to find some good Samaritan
to bear me company), with a party of road-menders;
I helped them break up the stones
and all that kind of thing. But after they
had packed up their tools and tea cans and
bid me 'thanks and good night,' I met fear
on the homeward road&mdash;a shadow among
shadows. It would be almost impossible to
describe the swerves that my mind took<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
from that time till the end. The presence
of the Albertus Magnus filled me by turns
with dread, blind fear, an overshadowed
sort of pleasure, and utter hopelessness. I
dare not have it taken away; and I knew
that its presence was driving me mad. The
vicar told me that if I could make up my
mind to have the statue removed or destroyed,
it might dispel all my troubles. I ought to
make an application to the authority on
bronzes at the British Museum, who would
be only too pleased to accept it. An application
to escape the company of Albertus
Magnus! A request that the British Museum
would graciously take over a bronze statue,
the soul of departed Ombos, and a blind
terror that walked at twilight! The vicar's
proposal sent me into a paroxysm of hysterical
laughter.</p>

<p>"I'd gone into the library one afternoon
about four, as I had heavy arrears of letter-writing
to make up. It was surprising that
I should choose that room where Albertus
Magnus towered in his corner&mdash;and (I don't
know why) I felt vaguely unhappy when I
had been separated too long from him. By
half past six I had finished. I went to the
door to ring for Clayton to post my letters,
and turned to light up the candelabra (I
forgot to say that it was a fad of my father's
all through his life to use candelabra in preference
to electric light or gas), when I heard,
I thought I heard a chuckle behind me&mdash;low,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
faint, but unmistakably malicious. The fate
of poor Price flashed into my mind, and at
the same time, I myself was watching myself
fight on that same chesterfield with something
horrible, unclean, intangible. I turned round
instantaneously, feeling that the Albertus
Magnus was at his hellish game again. With
sudden horror I saw where the chuckle had
come from. The statue had changed from
the bronze-green to a fleshy-green. It was
alive, and the great muscles were twitching
and quivering. To my unutterable horror, I
perceived it was not Albertus Magnus....
<i>It was Ombos!</i> His breath came in horrid
little flutters, with seconds between each
one, as if he had just come to life and was not
quite used to it. A dreadful viciousness and
vitality shone from his green eyes, and his
demon-like mouth was twisted into a grin of
unimaginable evil.</p>

<p>"'Gods don't grow in one night like
mushrooms,' he said with a leer. (There was
no mistake about his voice&mdash;it was Ombos;
the words rang through my brain as if they
had been shouted.) 'You can't expect a
statue to turn into a god in a breath, or to
come down and skip about ... it takes time
and faith.'</p>

<p>"At that moment I must have gone mad.
I snatched the heavy candelabra and with a
howl of rage I hurled it with all my force at
his narrow leering eyes. It struck the solid
bronze with a terrific crash and fell at the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
base of the pedestal whereon Ombos had
stood a moment before.</p>

<p>"Clayton rushed in at this juncture, and we
went into the sitting-room. I saw him wipe
his forehead with the back of his hand.</p>

<p>"'He's been here again, sir,' he said. 'I
was standing on the gravel path by the
library, a minute ago, when I saw him close by
me in the bushes. He came across the water-meadow,
I think. And any way he made off
back that way when I shouted at him. Begad,
though, it'll be worth a trifle to see who this
rascal is, sir. I wonder what he's after.
Not the common kind of assassin. What?'</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>"This was the climax; I felt that another
such encounter would drive me raving mad.
Somewhere there must be a natural explanation;
it was only a question of finding it.
Among other things it occurred to me that
someone, for reason unknown, might be
playing a series of practical jokes upon me,
but it was hard to believe a hoax of such
malignant and serious intent. Besides, it
did not explain the death of Price which, I
felt more and more convinced, was in some
way connected with the bronze statue. I
felt it would be my own fault if I did not get
some part of the mystery cleared up soon. It
was plain, too, that I must virtually act
alone. The first thing was to find a helper,
and after casting about me I thought of a
member of my company, John Travers, who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
had lost two fingers at Charleroi at the first
stage of the war. He was a giant in stature,
his muscular force would have warranted
him in contesting a fall or two with a full-grown
lion.</p>

<p>"I wrote to Travers the same evening and
his answer came a couple of days later,
saying that he would be down by the first
train that he could catch. I said nothing
in my letter about the bronze statue, but
merely mentioned that I feared a gang of
thieves had marked my house down, and I
wanted his help to guard the place for a week
or so.</p>

<p>"Well, Travers arrived. Armed with two
new service rifles, we each in turn kept watch
over the statue, agreeing that a shot out
of the window should warn the other, were
any sudden danger to arise.</p>

<p>"On the second night of our vigil I retired
to bed hugely sleepy. I had left Travers on
guard in the library. He was seated in an
armchair under my Albertus Magnus, with
his rifle over his knees. I did not take off
my clothes, but threw myself, dressed as I
was, upon the bed. Determining to make
sure of some rest I took a stiff glass of hot
brandy. I slept&mdash;I could scarcely help sleeping&mdash;but
not for long, for I suddenly awoke
from a tumultuous dream, my limbs atremble,
and my forehead sticky with cold sweat. It
seemed as though somebody was calling my
name from a vast distance. The room was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
full of whisperings and moanings and strange
uncanny things. Something was evidently
at work in my sub-consciousness. Nothing
was wrong with Travers or I should have
heard the report of his rifle. Yet something
<i>was</i> wrong! The conviction grew stronger
and stronger within me. Then came the
faint sound of rattling at the brass knob,
and with sudden horror I saw the door open
a couple of inches. A pause of some seconds
and it was pushed open still farther. For a
space of five seconds my heart seemed to
stop beating, and then the worst came. You
will think I was beside myself; but as the
door was pushed open a face peeped round
behind it, and I saw two green eyes looking
at me! I had at once recognised the face,
and the face was that of Ombos! He appeared
to smile at me, but it was a leer of inscrutable
evil and malevolence, and I took up my rifle
and fired at a venture. A howl of pain,
hoarse with anger, rent the air, and the face
vanished.... I rushed downstairs and into
the library. As I entered, the body of
Travers came twisting across the room like
a penny whirligig. His head struck the
marble fire-place with a frightful dull thud,
and he fell a motionless heap on the floor. I
struck straight in front of me with a rifle&mdash;and
hit something&mdash;something that pushed
past me. Then the front door opened and
shut with a deafening clang. A sudden
qualm of real fear took hold of my heart, but,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
mastering it as best I could, I opened the
front door and tore madly down the drive.
I looked down the hushed street. Past the
lamp-posts, skipping from the gloom into the
light and from light into shadow, with a series
of bounds, sped a horrible apish form. It
bounded along with incredible fleetness, and
was soon lost to view in the distant gloom.
Just at that moment Clayton came down the
drive. I could not speak. I pointed to
the library.... I beckoned him to follow.
On the floor lay the dead body of John
Travers. The statue of Albertus Magnus
had vanished!</p>

<p>"And there the story ends. I can give no
explanation whatever, beyond what I have
related. The bronze figure has never, so far
as I know, been seen again, nor has the restless
spirit of poor Ombos walked again in our
garden and library. But, taking the circumstances
into consideration, the whole train
of events points to the fact that Ombos <i>had</i>
in some occult way passed his ethereal body
into that statue, and for that very reason he
was unable to rest quietly in his grave."</p>

<p>"You will continue to live in the house at
Abbot's Ely, of course," said Duckford.</p>

<p>Crabbe shook his head. "Never! I wrote
a week ago putting it in the agent's hands for
sale. There may be nothing in it, but I hardly
want to make any new experiments now.
The bronze statue has disappeared. I should
like to think it was stolen by a gang of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
burglars. But I remember that chuckle&mdash;the
malicious mirth of some unearthly thing,
it seemed. And I remember ... let us leave
it at that. I want to forget, to walk in the
Sunshine, in the crowded Strand, away from
the darknesses and silences. As I say, there
the story ends.... I have told you all of it."</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>But Captain Crabbe did not tell it all. The
best part was "strictly private." He married
Margot at half-past ten on the following
Saturday morning but one, at St. George's,
Hart Street, Bloomsbury.</p>

<h2>II</h2>

<h3>THE DE GAMELYN TRADITIONS</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">He</span> was just an Irish soldier's son; a real
boy in real life, and his name was Tim, and
that was the only name he had besides his
surname which was Gamelyn. And somehow
he was perfectly happy. But one day he
found an old book and read about a boy
whose name was Victor; and the more he
read about Victor the more ardent was his
wish to be like Victor, and he wished that he
had been called Victor&mdash;for Victor was a
genius and a gentleman, and all things which
Victor put his hands to were crowned with
success. But Tim's name <i>was</i> Tim Gamelyn,
which was unfortunate; and when he went
to an English school at Margate they called
him, because his hair was red, "Carrots"
which was heartbreaking.</p>

<p>In the book nobody had ever jeered at
Victor or called him nicknames; they
would have been dealt with very severely,
besides they would not have dared; he was
far too heroic. So Tim became very furious
when the other fellows called him "Carrots."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
But the more he showed his dislike for this
name the more the boys made use of it, also
when they had time to spare&mdash;they warmed
their hands in the imaginary heat radiated by
his ruddy hair. It was impossible to uphold
any dignity under the circumstances, and he
began to wonder what Victor would have
done in a like predicament. But then Victor's
hair was rich and brown and curly, and no
one could have said a word against it; Tim's
was red and of the kind that fate keeps in
stock of the humble and low, and it made a
little lump come up in his throat when he
realized it. Then the football season on,
Victor, Tim well remembered, had gone in
for every kind of athletic sport. When he
had first arrived at a strange boarding school
he had refused, with a heedless laugh, to say
whether he could play or not. Victor did
not even deign to go near the football field
for a month. But ten minutes before the
Match of the year commenced he suddenly
made up his mind to play. During the first
half of the game Victor had "laid low"; he
was waiting. Then his eyes flashed, and his
lithe, active figure flashed up the field sending
the ball into the posts like a shot from a gun,
thus scoring the first and only goal. He had
then fainted away; and a beautiful girl had
exclaimed "A-a-a-a-a-h," and had hurried to
him with a smelling-bottle and much sympathy.
When he recovered, he sat up and
made an apology for stopping the game and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
was loudly cheered by both teams. This was
the model which Tim had to keep in his mind's
eye. In one or two ways he succeeded, and
in others he failed&mdash;failed dismally.</p>

<p>When Tim came to ask questions about
football at Thetford Grammar School he
found it was quite another thing. In the
first place the boys all spoke to him in that
specially offensive you're-only-a-little-kid sort
of way. They also took it for granted that
he had never seen a football in his life. He
found it impossible to refuse (with a careless
laugh) to say whether he had ever kicked a
ball before. He was told that he would
have to play in the next school practice
match, and that if he could kick a ball, he
might be allowed to play in a <i>real</i> match one
fine day. When the first practice game
commenced, Tim remembered that an enthusiastic
crowd had run by Victor's side,
shouting wildly: "Hurrah! hurrah for
Victor." It is true that a few of the smaller
boys shouted at him. But what they shouted
was: "Put a bit of life into it, old Carrots!"
and "Go it, Rufus! You'll never score a goal
if you kick the ball in that mother-may-I-have-an-orange
style." During the first part
of the game Tim was rather quiet&mdash;he was
waiting for a golden opportunity, just as
Victor had waited. It came when the forwards
were in full movement, and the ball
came travelling neatly along the line on the
right wing. It finally came to rest at Tim's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
feet, and he, avoiding a man who darted at
him, raced forward a few yards. Then
something, which came through the air like
a Whitehead Torpedo, sent him spinning
backwards on the grass. Amidst roars of
laughter from the other fellows, the Whitehead
Torpedo, (who was a boy and smaller
than Tim), spun round, ran the ball a few
dozen yards, and sent it soaring away with
a vent kick straight for the goal. There was a
moment of silence. The ball pitched fair
and square on the top bar, and then trickled
gently between the posts.</p>

<p>A howl of joy went up from the small fry
who had been "ragging" Tim all the time.</p>

<p>Tim sat up and looked about him. He
had not fainted, but he felt very sick and
dizzy, and nobody sympathised with him.
A small freckle-faced boy was standing over
him.</p>

<p>"The ground <i>is</i> slippery to-day," he grinned,
extending a hand to the unfortunate Tim, who
lay on the sludgy, squdgy mud gasping like
a recently-landed trout.</p>

<p>Tim accepted, and scrambled painfully to
his feet. The pomp of battle had departed
from him.</p>

<p>A few weeks afterwards, as Tim was walking
across the water meadows, he saw a youth
of serious and agricultural appearance throwing
a poor, defenceless little terrier into the
mill stream. Every time the miserable little
animal crawled up on to the river bank the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
youth hurled it into the deep water again.
Now, that was the kind of thing that Victor
was very down on. In every chapter Victor
punished people for cruelty to animals.
Victor's blood always boiled at such a sight&mdash;moreover,
his strong arm always shot out,
his eyes always flashed, and the great hulking
coward <i>always</i> lay prone at his feet begging
for mercy with clasped hands. So Tim
gathered together his recollections of Victor's
stock phrases, and advanced on the stolid
youth:</p>

<p>"You cowardly ruffian! Have you no
feelings that you ill-treat a man's best friend
in that way?"</p>

<p>The stolid-looking youth seemed slightly
astonished. He thrust his face forward and
shook his fist under Tim's nose. "Not
your blooming business," he said. "You
shift."</p>

<p>"You've got no right," began Tim.</p>

<p>"Right!" The youth's note was fierce.
Then he took poor Tim by the scruff of his
neck, and observed that he had been teaching
the pup to swim because he was water-shy,
and that it was good for all kinds of pups to
know how to swim. Then he pushed Tim
into the water after the pup in order to teach
him to keep his mouth shut and mind his own
business.</p>

<p>Tim went away with the idea (perfectly
correct) that the stolid-looking youth's hands
that had gripped his neck and the seat of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
knickers were very strong, and another
impression that even Victor would not have
stood an earthly chance against such a fellow.
And it was just then that he was aware of
a little grey idea floating in the background
of his mind that Victor was a bit of a prig&mdash;also
a fraud. It annoyed him that any such
notion should occur to him that the glory of
his hero was an illusion, and he shook his
head to get rid of it. Then his brain sent
a "wireless" that Victor might be all right
in a little toy world of his own, peopled entirely
by heroes and scoundrels, and with all the
scoundrels physically contemptible; but that
he would have done less brilliantly in the
mixed-up old world that we have got at
present.</p>

<p>Suddenly, as from a clear sky, came a bolt
of common-sense to Tim, and he realized he
had been a fond and foolish jay. And that
was why, when he had finished prep that
evening, he exchanged a copy, bound in calf,
of <i>Victor the Valiant</i> for two oranges and a
catapult.</p>

<p>Of course, the reaction set in. Tim was
sent up to the station to bring home a new
bicycle for the head master, and he was
especially warned <i>not</i> to ride it&mdash;just to walk
it. Of course he tried to ride it down Castle
Hill, and collided violently with a milk cart.
He returned with what had been a new
machine. So the Head made him write out
one hundred times<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>:</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">And since he cannot spend or use aright<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The little time here given in his trust;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But wasteth it in weary underlight<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of foolish toil and trouble, strife and lust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He naturally clamours to inherit<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Everlasting Future that his merit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May have full scope&mdash;as surely is most just.<br /></span>
</div>

<p>And Tim muttered, "All right, keep your
hair on, Ben!"</p>

<p>"H'm;" said the Head, overhearing Tim.
"Write it out <i>two</i> hundred times for your
insolent conduct."</p>

<p>That was the start of his demoralisation.
According to the laws of the Medes and
Persians, and the laws of Victor the Valiant,
disaster and dishonour would be the end of
<i>this</i>! It was not at all the way Victor would
have behaved. As a matter of fact on one
occasion when a master had been idiotic
enough to give Victor a hundred lines, the
valiant one had replied: "Pardon me, sir,
but if I may be so presumptuous I think I
can call your attention to the fact that you&mdash;unintentionally,
of course&mdash;are treating me
too severely." And the master had at once
seen the error of his ways and relieved Victor
of the imposition.</p>

<p>Tim failed to get the verse written out in
the stipulated time and the imposition was
trebled. Also he gathered up another hundred
lines for "failure to attend prayers" and this
placed him in a state of hopeless bankruptcy.</p>

<p>When he wrote home to his mother. Here
is what he said:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dearest Mother:</span></p>

<p class="sp1">"I got two hundred lines for breaking
the Head's bicycle yesterday. Give my love
to Dad. I got another hundred lines to-day
for not being present at prayers. But don't
you worry&mdash;I am not really bad&mdash;God has
forgotten me, that is all.</p>

<div class="rgt"><span class="sp2">"Your loving Son,</span><br />
<span class="smcap">Tim</span>."</div></div>

<p>And Tim&mdash;such was his natural depravity&mdash;did
not much care. So callous and indifferent
did he become that he ceased to
be hurt when the boys called him "Carrots."
In fact he laughed. And as he no longer
objected when he was called "Carrots" the
boys dropped that name, and the shortest
one survived. The boys started to call him
"Tims" and in a few months he had won
their affection from the lowest fag to the
highest lad in the school.</p>

<p>Two years afterwards, by dint of practice
and pluck he had so far advanced that he
ran second in the quarter-mile at the Sports.
Of course this was not very heroic. He was
rewarded for this feat of strength with a
patent egg-boiler, which was of no sort of
use to him, and, as he discovered afterwards,
of no use to anybody else. But he was
exceedingly proud of the thing and also
exceedingly careful to conceal this fact from
the other boys.</p>

<p>He became, to sum up his attitude, less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
and less like Victor. But it is not to be
presumed that he was sinking into mental
nothingness. He was not perhaps quite so
refined in his language as he might have
been, he used slang, and sometimes was
inclined to hang his hat on the floor and
talk back. He was rather untidy in his
dress. But certain compensating qualities
of the highest value were appearing in Tim.
He had gathered to himself a plentiful supply
of gumption&mdash;genius is all right, but if it
comes to a slow-down gumption is better.
His hatred of "swank" reached the point
of unreasoning prejudice. He made many
mistakes; but depend upon this: the man
who has never made a mistake has never
made anything else worth having.</p>

<p>And Tim never became a great soldier, or a
great sailor, or anything great. But he had
good spirits, and he concealed about his
person a heart of gold; and after he left
Thetford Grammar School, boys found that
somehow the games in the old playground
seemed flat and spiritless. They said that
things weren't as they used to be in Tim's
time.</p>

<p>I have told the reader that Tim Gamelyn's
father was a retired non-commissioned officer
who lived near Dublin on a small private income
and a pension. It will be seen that
Tim's people did not roll in wealth any to
speak of. They owned a small farm with
five cows, twenty pigs and a flock of hens.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
There was beer always in the cellar, bacon
hanging up in the kitchen and a bucket of
soft soap in the out-house. In the top
lean-to room where Tim slept, in the winter
time the rain and sleet drifted cheerily in
through the cracks and covered the army
blankets which covered him. But he didn't
lie awake thinking about it&mdash;boys like Tim
who help on farms start playing shut-eye
as soon as they hit the pillow.</p>

<p>Old Sergeant Gamelyn came of an ancestry
which, somebody or other of distinction once
said&mdash;and very truly&mdash;is the backbone of the
British Army. To put it briefly, if not
gracefully, "what old Gamelyn didn't know
about soldiering weren't worth knowin'!"
He had the ten thousand and ten commandments
of the King's Regulations always at his
finger tips, and he and his people had served
in the same battalion, under the same officers
or descendants for generations. There was
Michael Gamelyn who fell at Malplaquet;
there was another Gamelyn who had served
at Minden; four Gamelyns served through
the Peninsular. But only one came through
to Waterloo. Balaclava, the Indian Mutiny
and Spion Kop each claimed a Gamelyn, and
when the British troops returned from Lhasa
in 1904 they left one Sergeant Royden
Gamelyn&mdash;resting in peace ten paces to the
rear of the Pargo Keeling Gate. Of course
Tim Gamelyn grew up in the shadow of these
things. There was an old book in his father's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
oak kit box which Tim loved. In it he read
about forgotten drill and manual exercises,
the uncomfortable and graceless man&#339;uvres
of the rigid but redoubtable men who fought
at Waterloo. Also there were pictures in
colour of warriors in three-cornered hats,
high stocks and powdered wigs. These men
Tim worshipped. He had by heart the
quaint words of command in which Wellington's
men were told to charge a musket with
powder and ball. And I doubt not that he
could have taken a brigade and marched
them to the attack with the best of the old-time
sergeants.</p>

<p>Then in August 1914 came the great war,
and when Tim suggested going into Dublin
to see Colonel Arbuthnot about joining up
to that battalion through which all the best
of the Gamelyn men had passed, his mother
tried to laugh. But Tim saw the tears
running down her cheeks, as she threw her
apron over her head and went out to bring the
clothes in off the line. His father then flung
out his hand to him and said:</p>

<p>"Good boy, I thought 'twas in you. Good
luck."</p>

<p>But when Tim joined his regiment soldiering
had taken many new turns. The modern
rifle would not allow men to march into battle
with colours flying and bands playing: the
old brave way was impossible in the face
of machine guns. The pomp and pageantry
of battle had departed and there was nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
left but for the attacking party to crawl in a
most inelegant fashion upon the ground.</p>

<p>"Down!" cried the sergeant-instructor
to poor Tim, who started his lessons in field
training with some vague idea about marching
on the foe with "head and eyes erect" and
with "pace unfaltering and slow." "When
you get out to Flanders you will have to get
right down on your belly if you want to <i>live</i>
a little longer than ten minutes. Extend to
five-six-ten paces and get as close to old
mother earth as possible and hide your
bloomin' selves!"</p>

<p>"Hide yourselves!" thought Tim. "Not
thus is it written in my father's book of
drill! It plainly said therein that the duty
of a soldier was to learn how to die, not to
hide from death."</p>

<p>Crushed and dejected he returned that
morning to breakfast to wolf a chunk of bread
and butter, washed down by dishwater,
misnamed tea.</p>

<p>After breakfast he retired to a corner and
thought it all out. The words of the Sergeant
came back to him: "<i>Hide yourself if yer
want to live!</i>"</p>

<p>These words stuck in his memory, as words
which bring a new light on an outlook will.
That was the start of his demoralisation. He
was the first of all his line who had been told
to hide himself from death. No more the
worsted bravery, the pipeclay, lace and
scarlet. No more the old military swagger.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
No more the drummer boy with a waist like
a French dancing girl, wrists like Bombardier
Wells, and shoulders like a wooden man out
of a Noah's Ark. No more the throbbing and
growling of the drums; the staccato detonations
and the insolent crescendoes of the
drums. No more the wild music that the
bands played to the men who fought at
Minden, Malplaquet and Wynendael. No
more the brushing of a comrade's arm one's
own, inspiring boldness; no more a thousand
red coats marching on the enemy with slow
and unfaltering pace. Tim could see the
men of his dreams now, in his mind's eye,
marching with heads and eyes erect ... see,
too, the smoke of continuous volleys bursting
out along the steady lines as they fired by
sections and companies on their foes. Well,
it was all a thing of the past now. It was
plainly his duty not to be reckless. "Do
not be dashing, do not expose yourself, do
not cheer and make a noise," they said;
"creep along like a worm in the grass; be
crafty, be wary&mdash;and fall down on the face
before death."</p>

<p>It did not stop there. Lastly and worst
they took away the officers of his dreams.
They even dressed them like privates and
some were armed with rifles. There were no
flashing swords to follow. Not once did he
see an officer anything like his father's picture
of the Duke of Wellington on the white horse
pointing a curly sword to the skies and waving<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
a cocked hat. Then there came the day when
Tim made his first acquaintance with field
training, and beheld a loose and disorderly
scramble which men called an advance. To
him it seemed just a mob of masterless men,
crawling and crouching on the grass, firing
as they passed, and bowing cringingly before
death. It was a sight he could hardly endure&mdash;an
exhibition offensive to any soldier whose
forbears had learnt to achieve the impossible
as a matter of routine and had held firm for
half a day at Quatre Bras with never so
much as the flicker of an eye-lid. Gad! there
could only be one end to this kow-towing to
death, and that would be disaster and disgrace.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>The long dull plains of northern Europe
stretched before Tim's gaze&mdash;great undulations
of hard, hot earth and waving grass.
He'd been marching all day, and it was hot.
Hot!... ye Gods!... On those plains it
was like a Turkish bath. Then "down"
came the order, and the battalion flung itself
to the ground. Oh, but it was good to rest!
Towards sunset the clouds piled up blacker
and blacker, and some hung frothy over the
ridge in the distance. As the sun dropped,
the west turned red&mdash;all blood red&mdash;and he
heard the order to march. He heard the
word passed down the line in half whispers,
and the impressive sound of regiments getting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
under arms came to his ears. Another five
miles they marched and halted for tea. Then
all the men became very silent&mdash;and while
they rested they talked in whispers as they
watched the awful sky. When it grew dark
the flick-flack of lightening played across the
sky and it showed the men's faces white and
drawn. Presently Tim's Company lieutenant
came up with the news that they would not be
able to rest until morning as they had anticipated.
There could be no stopping, for the
regiment had to reach the rendezvous at daybreak.
As the storm rolled nearer, the wind
got up, in puffs&mdash;first warm and then cold, and
a few drops of rain fell&mdash;great drops that fell
flop-flop-flop&mdash;on Tim's face. With a
flash that leapt crackling over the plain, the
storm loosed itself. The lightning turned
the rain into sheets of glittering silver, and
the hot ground fairly boiled. Tim, with a
thousand others drenched, and blinded,
struggled over the slippery turf. That was
a storm. Tim could have seen to read; and
the thunder wrestled in the low churning
clouds like a million devils, and through it
all ran the chorus of wind and lashing rain.
Presently the storm lessened and died away,
and the rain settled to pour down on them
for an hour or so. The squelch-squelch of
soaking boots and the creaking of leather
equipment was all he heard. They halted
for breakfast, and Tim chewed his rations
sitting on the sodden ground in sodden<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
clothes; and as he sipped his lukewarm
coffee, he shivered in the coming dawn.</p>

<p>Almost immediately they went on again.</p>

<p>Right before them, at the head of a valley,
rose a ridge. In the creepy light it looked
miles high and a million spitting points of
fire flashed from it. The British guns in
the woods at the back then began, and they
seemed to have no relation to the unvarying
plumes of smoke bursting above the long
lines of fresh-turned earth two thousand yards
away&mdash;no connection with the screeching
of the shells overhead. "Extended order!"
came the command, and Tim with his regiment
stumbled forward. His breath came
and went in little painful gasps. From the
right came a curious gasping choke, and
looking, he saw the man next to him throw up
his arms and pitch forward on his face.
Suddenly he became aware of a peculiar
wailing above him, as if the air itself was in
torture. Again a long line of fire flashed
out ahead of him and again came the wailing
sound. A Boche machine-gun loosed a few
belts of cartridges in the spasmodic style of
her kind. There was no mistake about it
this time&mdash;massed infantry were sweeping
the plain with rifle fire, and the quick-firers
were feeling for an opening.</p>

<p>Another man was hit&mdash;close to Tim. He
squealed like a girl; and a fellow near turned a
dirty white, stumbled, with a clatter fell in
a fainting fit. Tardily the men advanced,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
and any acute observer would have seen they
had little heart in the business. Some hung
behind almost unconsciously, and had to be
hurried up by the sergeants. The bullets
became more thick. A man started to
blubber behind. "Gawd 'ave mercy! I ...
I can't stand it! I won't go on!" he whined.
It turned out to be a sergeant, who had
broken down too. He'd had little rest, poor
chap, through shepherding his company ...
and now he had knocked under. The company
swayed and hesitated. Some of them
faced round. It was touch and go. "Steady
there! Steady! Come on, men;" said
Stansfield, the little company lieutenant, as
the men wavered on the grey edge of collapse.
"Steady that company; what in hell's the
matter with 'em. Keep your men up and
going, Sir!" shouted a captain rushing
over. But the company had gone all to
pieces. The fire of battle had departed
from them, and it flung itself on the ground.
And soon the whole battalion was taking
cover in the same way. A captain called on
Tim's company to advance. Two men obeyed
and one of them was Tim. But the enemy's
fire redoubled and the other man was shot,
and so Tim at once took cover again. The
saying of his sergeant-instructor in England
came to his mind, that a man must lie down
and hide if he wished to live, and he felt
quite justified in hugging the earth. Tim
ached in every inch of his body. Surely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
something was snapping in his brain, for
those dusty khaki figures on the ground, the
sky, the earth all seemed to be dancing
madly about him. It was not yet light and
Tim strained his eyes to pierce the darkness.
Then he made a discovery. A dark mass,
like some prehistoric monster, was gradually
approaching. Tim spoke to a man next
to him who was softly swearing and bandaging
a shattered hand. He peered through the
light and half-light of dawn, and then started
to laugh in a nervous way. "Hell, mate;"
he said, "the whole German race are advancing
against us; it's all up with us.
Look, they are coming on like a solid wall ...
springing out of the earth just solid ... no
end to 'em."</p>

<p>It was just about that time that Tim
observed a light mist rising in front of him.
It seemed to scintillate and sparkle as it
rose, and curled in a sort of pillar or spiral.
"Great Heaven!" he whispered to himself,
"the thing is taking shape."</p>

<p>And true enough, in a very few moments
he saw standing erect in front of him a
tall man&mdash;and he was dressed in shining
armour; that was the strange thing about
him. A strange-looking fellow this! He
was more like a Spaniard than an Englishman,
with black eyes and olive complexion.
His expression was lofty and noble, and his
tall lithe figure was in strict accordance with
British traditions. So were the bold features,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
which were rather marred by a white scar
which stretched from his left nostril to the
angle of his jaw. But the jet-black hair
and the eyes&mdash;the deep, dark, challenging
eyes&mdash;were those of Seville. A straight sword
by his side and a painted long-bow at his
shoulder proclaimed him a bowman. A white
surcoat with the red lion of St. George upon
it covered his broad chest, while a sprig of
new-plucked furze at the side of his steel
cap gave a touch of gaiety to his grim war-worn
clothes.</p>

<p>No sooner had Tim looked up than a deep
rich voice exclaimed:</p>

<p>"<i>Corpus Domini!</i> do you need a
leader?"</p>

<p>Tim was not a man to be easily startled,
and with the bullets whining and ping-thudding
all around him, it was no manner
of a time to be easily startled. But the voice,
on account of its unearthly sound, fairly made
him jump. He picked up his rifle, and stood
upright. "Come along! Come along!" the
voice went on. "Why dost stand there, De
Gamelyn?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my God! I ... I can't stand it!
The loss of blood and the marching has done
for me!"</p>

<p>"So! coming into the fight like a lion,
you go out like a lamb. By Saint Paul! this
is not in accordance with the De Gamelyn
traditions. Take up thy arms! Come along!"
said the stranger tapping him on the shoulder<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
with a barbed shaft trimmed with grey goose
feather.</p>

<p>"Oh! please ... please.... I'm so
tired!" said Tim, like a child speaking to
its nurse.</p>

<p>The bowman saw that the boy's lips and
tongue were black with thirst, and his eyes
were blood-shot. And when Tim staggered
over to him all his body heaved and trembled
like an overdriven horse. Sick and dizzy
with pain, he cast himself to earth again, and
waited for death. "Why don't they hit
me?... I've tried,&mdash;oh, so hard!" he
sobbed.</p>

<p>"Steady there! Steady, De Gamelyn!
Take this," said the bowman, and drew something
from his side and handed it to him. It
was a sword, if swords be made of fire, of
lightning, of dazzling lights; and the moment
Tim grasped it all his pain and dizziness fell
from him.</p>

<p>"What is this?" he asked.</p>

<p>"The Sword of Life and Death," said the
bowman.</p>

<p>"Who the blazes are you?" Tim asked
sceptically.</p>

<p>It was with a touch of the Irish brogue that
a cheery voice answered. "A friend to a
friend," said the bowman, "and the devil to
a foe."</p>

<p>"Irish?" Tim questioned.</p>

<p>"Citizen of the world in time past ...
now a citizen of heaven."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Tim gazed at the strange man in earnest
scrutiny. He appeared quite at his ease with
bullets whining around him and he unslung a
jack of wine and drank.</p>

<p>"May a parched man claim a drink of your
wine?" Tim cried.</p>

<p>"Give what you have, ask what you need.
That is the De Gamelyn code of law," said
the man, and handed Tim the flagon.</p>

<p>"You are cheerful, sir," said Tim, his blood
somewhat warmed by the wine. "In the
name of the devil, who are you, and of what
country?"</p>

<p>"My name is Nigel De Gamelyn. My
Mother, dear soul, was French. My father
was wise enough to be an Irishman. So
much for my blood, which unites happily
the practical and the dreamer fluids. I am of
no country but I know all places from the
King's tombs at Rome to the old inns that
stand about the upper Arun. I have marched
with armies over this territory aforetime.
There is no shadow, I believe, on my soul,
has such strength in him as I, and I rest
content to be nothing to myself and all
things to every man. That being bliss."</p>

<p>As the bowman spoke, a bullet kicked up
a cloud of dust at his feet.</p>

<p>"Hol&agrave;, by my hilt! it is time that we were
stirring," he said. "Leave these fellows to
grovel and remove yourself. Follow: who
follows Nigel de Gamelyn?" He hitched up
his belt and strode forward with his great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
bow, and Tim saw him send a shaft with a
twanging noise five hundred and thirty paces.
One of the German officers, towering above
the other men, stood out distinctly, and
then he dropped.</p>

<p>"I'd like to take a look at that knave,"
the bowman remarked, drawing a fresh arrow
from his sheaf. "By the twang of string! I'll
swear I drilled him clean between his eyes."</p>

<p>The enemy were getting closer now, and
from the men lying around them broke a
violent fusillade. It was quite useless, but
it relieved their nerves. Some were discharging
their shots into the turf a few yards
in front of them. Others were shooting at
aeroplanes.</p>

<p>Then suddenly there came upon Tim a
great anger. A bullet striking him brought
him to his senses, and he saw the men sprawling
belly-flat about him. This was not war,
this ignominious crawling, this grovelling in
the soil, this halting! The spirit of his fathers
spoke to him. He remembered one of his
father's favourite sayings: "The duty of a
man of the line is to fight, and if needs be, die,
not to avoid dying." His anger grew&mdash;"damn
them for a pack of cringing, footling
cowards: he, Tim Gamelyn, descendant of
the De Gamelyns who fought in a hundred
battles, would teach them how men of his
father's house went into battle."</p>

<p>A senior officer called on those nearest to
Tim to advance. And men rose up.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span></p>

<p>"D. Company, fix bayonets! Close in!"
came the order. Tim gripped his sword and
strode over to the Bowman. Then the advancing
Germans poured a blasting volley on
them.</p>

<p>"The Old Battalion&mdash;<i>charge!</i>" came the
stentorian voice of a senior. The men
scrambled to their feet, and Tim following the
Bowman sprang ahead of the Battalion. The
men leapt across the blood-smeared grass
after them with the speed of a winged fury,
but they struck the Germans a dozen yards
ahead of the battalion. The bowman had
hurled aside his long bow and was using a
short battle mace with terrific effect. As for
Tim: all he wanted to do was to slash; stab
and slash again with that wonderful sword.
There followed a nightmare of drawn, grinning
faces, of fierce yells and groans. The mud-stained
grey figures struck at him wildly,
futilely. On and on Tim went, his glittering
blade now at a white face, now at a throat,
now at a chest, still stabbing and thrusting
to pass through the wall of men which barred
his way.</p>

<p>The man with the bow ranged up alongside
him: "On, man, on, in the name of God,
march forward.... By St. George and Our
Lady! we are breaking up their front;"
he muttered.</p>

<p>"Strike me crimson!" bellowed a man
near to Tim, "but you're a blooming marvel!
Those German beggars are going down for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
twenty yards around your (decorated) sword
without being hit at all. Look! Look!
there goes another Hun down. Let me come
over near you, mate!"</p>

<p>But Tim knew that De Gamelyn the Bowman
had summoned to their help the armies
of the unconquered dead. They came, the
De Gamelyns of all generations from Cr&eacute;cy
to Waterloo: they fought by his side, and
the machine gun bullets, which fell upon the
dusty earth like tropical rain, hurt them
not.</p>

<p>Again and again the Bowman's mace
smashed and lashed out before him, and Tim
thrust, and thrust yet again with his sword.
He heard the deep-throated roar of the bowman's
singing "The Song of the Bow."</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 18em;">
<span class="i0">What of the shaft?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The shaft was cut in England:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A long shaft, a strong shaft,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Barbed and trim and true;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So we'll drink all together<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To the grey goose feather<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the land where the grey goose flew.<br /></span>
</div>

<p class="noin">Suddenly a yell, horrible and fierce, uprose
from the soldiers, and he heard the bowman's
voice no more.</p>

<p>"They're on the run, by Gawd, they've
got it right in the neck this journey," bellowed
a soldier as the German infantry broke and
tailed away. Then something took Tim in
the chest, something wet and red, that went
through him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span></p>

<p>The man next to Tim saw the long bayonet
stand out beyond his back, saw Tim sway,
laughing, and snap the steel short as he fell
upon it.</p>

<p>A body of kilted men suddenly swept from
the right of the hard-pressed battalion, swept
by in silence, and in silence swept the remaining
Boches up one side of the ridge and
down the other into eternity.</p>

<p>Two days later Colonel Arbuthnot inquired
after the welfare of Private Tim Gamelyn
at the field hospital.</p>

<p>"He was admitted suffering from sunstroke,
and a terrible bayonet wound. He died
early in the morning," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"Is it true that he saved the battalion by
urging our fellows on at the critical moment?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Colonel Arbuthnot, "but do
you happen to know if he had an officer's
sword with him by chance when he was
carried in here? All my men speak of a
'sword of flame' with which he drove the
Huns before him. Even hardened soldiers
who have been through many campaigns have
been babbling all sorts of nonsense of ghostly
regiments of bowmen who helped to turn the
German attack!"</p>

<p>The doctor walked over to a shelf, and,
taking down a rusty old sword, placed it on
the table.</p>

<p>"Perhaps that is what you refer to, Colonel,"
he said. "Where the fellow picked it up is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
a mystery to me. It must be some hundreds
of years old."</p>

<p>Colonel Arbuthnot took it in his hands and
read this inscription on the blade:</p>

<h3>THE MILLS OF GOD</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">They</span> were putting little Boudru to bed&mdash;the
R.H.A. and the Corps of Royal Engineers
and Stansfield, the big fat Infantry Sergeant.
His little sister, already tucked up in bed, was
nearly asleep. Boudru had been allowed to
stay up till Sergeant Stansfield had come in
from duty. The special privilege had been
accorded to the little French boy on this, the
last night that the British troops were to
spend in the village. Boudru's home was in
a portion of our line in which the defence
trenches were of the semi-detached type&mdash;they
did not join up with the other part of
the line, and at times the place was distinctly
unhealthy. Sometimes it was in the hands
of the Huns, sometimes the British rushed
it, and held on for a few weeks; there had
been times when it had been occupied by
both, at other times it was written on the
squared official maps as no man's land. It
was a spot in which there was always a feeling
of something dreadful being close at hand;
there was an air of expectancy about it and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
one felt there was a marked atmosphere of
nerves about. You might be sniped from
the house opposite, or blown out of the
windows by a seventeen-inch shell. You
never know. The man who sold you tobacco
the day before might be lying stiff in the
gutter next day, or more probably still, he
might be dining with the German Staff a
mile and a half away. All this uncertainty,
coupled with the fact that the place was full
of spies, and that valuable information had
been finding its way through to the German
lines, made the General decide to withdraw
his troops and take up some trenches behind
it.</p>

<p>Boudru sat on the big armchair and swung
his white bare legs defiantly. Perhaps it had
better be explained that my lord Boudru
was five years old. "Boudru going to shut
eye?" said the fat infantry sergeant suggestively.</p>

<p>"The cots are down and the beds unrolled,"
said the R.H.A. man falling into the diction
of the barrack-room.</p>

<p>"No," said Boudru. "You must tell me
for the last time the story about the wicked
German baby killer who was turned into a
pig. The man of the guns must tell it, and
the fat man of the infantry shall hide beneath
the bed and make pig shrieks&mdash;many pig
shrieks&mdash;at the time when he is killed."</p>

<p>"But we shall disturb little sister Elise,"
said the fat sergeant with visions of a dismal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
ten minutes wedged beneath the small cot
and the floor.</p>

<p>"Elise is not bye-o yet," piped a thin
voice from where two eyes were sparkling
elfishly from a tangle of golden locks.</p>

<p>"Go on, my English man&mdash;There was once
a big fat baby killer who lived in Potsdam ..."</p>

<p>Then the R.H.A. man (a journalist by
profession, a duke by inclination, and now by
destiny a very clever gunner) began the
famous story. Never before had the telling
of that tale been given with such splendour
of effect. The fat sergeant had made pig-noises
with multitudinous yells in at least
fifteen different keys, and the little cross-eyed
driver of the Engineers had dressed up in a
real Hun helmet and grey coat. The grand
finale in which the Engineer had turned into
a pig on all fours and had been mercilessly
put to death with the fat sergeant's bayonet,
had filled Boudru's soul with joy. He reflected
and gloated on the scene far into the
night. Then he fell fast asleep and met with
most dazzling adventures with a German
soldier who had been hiding in the Jacobean
oak chest with the fleur-de-lis carved on the
side, which stands beneath the bulgy leaded
window.</p>

<p>As a grey and wretched dawn came in
with a cold and dispiriting rain there came
to the ears of little Boudru the steady champing
of marching feet in the street below.
Slush, slush, slush went all those feet, beating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
the muddy road, and then the noise of metal
on metal woke the silent village streets as
the guns went by.</p>

<p>"The soldiers! The soldiers!" exclaimed
Boudru as he bounded over and jumped on
to the Jacobean chest to watch them pass.
It was fated that they were the last English
soldiers that Boudru would ever see.</p>

<p>Some weeks later Boudru's mother was
busy with odd jobs in the kitchen garden
and the children were playing in the front
room, there was a ring at the door and the
sound of a butt-end of a rifle, as it "grounded"
on the cobble stones. When Boudru on tiptoe
lifted the latch, the door swung open, and
a big man in a greenish uniform stood before
him. There was no sign of cap-badge or
title on his shoulder straps, and he was horribly
dirty. He carried two English ration bags,
besides his own rucksack, and they were all
filled to bursting with loot. Evil beamed
from his narrow, leering eyes; and when he
smiled at Boudru it twirled his demon-like
mouth into a grotesque shape. He looked
both depraved and suspicious, a disreputable
scoundrel with a gun, and that, you will find
in the fullness of time, was just what he
was.</p>

<p>"Let us shut the door," said Elise. "This
is not a pretty man." But the man from
Stettin pushed past.</p>

<p>"Brat;" said he, "drink."</p>

<p>Boudru's mother had hurried up to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
door as fast as her bulk and her stout legs
would permit.</p>

<p>Every day she had expected a visit from
the Huns. It was useless to argue with such
a man, so she took the German in.</p>

<p>"Brandy," said the man.</p>

<p>"There is only a little left ... it is over
there, on the sideboard."</p>

<p>The soldier walked over, finished half a
bottle, and announced that it was like water.</p>

<p>"More," he ordered, "Shoot you if no
find."</p>

<p>The woman at last managed to unearth a
bottle of good Burgundy and another bottle
of brandy.</p>

<p>He drank both the bottles, and when he
had finished, he asked for more like every
other Boche will do. Then he chose the
front bedroom and threw himself down on
the bed in a drunken sleep.</p>

<p>When the next morning broke the French
woman went to awaken the thief and while the
latter was making his toilet little Boudru
entered. He regarded the Hun with gravity
for at least five minutes and then delivered
himself of his opinion.</p>

<p>"I don't like you," he said slowly, regarding
the Hun, with his elfish eyes. "I don't like
you. I think you may be like the man in
the English soldiers' story, who turned into
a pig&mdash;a baby killer perhaps. It is because
of your red hair that I think you may turn ..."</p>

<p>The man from Stettin who had been trying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
to drag a comb through his horrible beard
and hair, turned, and he looked like a big
red devil, the sun being on his head, and red
beard and all.</p>

<p>"What's that?" he said, as he lurched
ominously across the room. He had swallowed
the contents of a flask of Benedictine
which he had taken from his rucksack, and
the repeated drinks were taking effect.</p>

<p>"I'll sweep the house, so there isn't a bug
in a blanket left&mdash;you damned brat!" He
was bellowing like a bull, chewing his red
beard and muttering to himself. As he
passed a table, he knocked the empty flask
on the floor. It did not break, and he
viciously stamped his feet on it, smashing it
to pieces. He began to go mad from that
moment. As he kicked the wreckage about
the room, his glance fell upon his rifle with
the fixed bayonet. And then the swine-dog
ran amok. Boudru stood with his back to
the door: the blood froze in his veins, and
his little body stiffened into absolute rigidity.</p>

<p>"Turn into a pig!" shrieked the Hun.
"What did you say? Turn into ..."</p>

<p>The bayonet flashed, and little Boudru&mdash;but
what followed shall not be printed. It
would be passing the decent bounds of
descriptive writing to put it in black and
white. It is sufficient to say that some
minutes later the Hun prised the floor-boards
up with his bayonet, and Boudru, from that
moment, without warning, or leaving any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
trace, disappeared from the world. He returned
in the fullness of time. And this was
the way of it.</p>

<p>For the hundredth time that day, the
Hun had gone into the bedroom to look out
of the bulgy bedroom window. Fear began
to come over him without any warning, and
he was thinking of little Boudru down there
in the dark. The thing within him that
served him for a heart was beating queer
rhythms ... the beating sounded like a
regiment of British Infantry on the march.</p>

<p>"Look," said he to the housewife, "look
out on the road. Do you see soldiers?"</p>

<p>The good woman, distraught between suspense
and hope for her little one, who had
been missing for six long hours, blinked away
a tear on her lashes and peered through the
diamond panes.</p>

<p>No one was to be seen. But between
three and four in the morning the first faint
champing of marching feet could be heard
and the Hun came down from the bedroom
looking as pale as death. He opened the
door and stood there listening. The insolent
crunch, crunch, crunch of heavy nail-studded
service boots came nearer, and a khaki
column appeared on the winding road. The
housewife, whose aching eyes had searched the
road for Boudru all day, saw them too.</p>

<p>"Look," she cried, "look! The English
soldiers are coming. Do you see?"</p>

<p><i>They were coming!</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>The man from Stettin rushed up to the
bedroom, and jumped into the oak chest.</p>

<p>"Not tell the English! Not tell!"</p>

<p>Fifteen or twenty soldiers were to be heard
grounding rifles and throwing off their equipment
in front of the house.</p>

<p>Entered here Sergeant Stansfield, and
shouted gaily to the housewife, but the
moment he looked into her pale and worn
face he understood that some sorrow had
befallen her. Before he could hold her she
had slid silently down on the floor, at his
feet, and covered her face. "Ah,&mdash;ah,&mdash;ah!
O God, help and pity me! They have
taken my little son," she cried.</p>

<p>At this moment a soldier rushed in at the
door. "I think there is a man who looks
like a Boche trying to get out of the bedroom
window!" he said. "Will you come, Sergeant?
Quick!"</p>

<p>The sergeant went quickly, and returned
with some men with fixed bayonets and led
them up to the bedroom: He told them
to break in. The man was on his knees,
with his horrible hands lifted up in supplication.
The soldiers kicked the man up
and made him go downstairs into the front
room.</p>

<p>"See!" said a soldier, who held his bayonet
ready, "there is blood on his sleeve." The
Hun cursed within his heart.</p>

<p>"It was none of my shedding," he whimpered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>"I had not said so," returned the sergeant
quietly.</p>

<p>"We are here to find that out. Perhaps
you know something about the lost child?"</p>

<p>"I had no hand in it, God strike me dead!"
the Hun answered fervently.</p>

<p>At that moment there was a sort of earthquake
upstairs, a clash of falling bricks and
slates, a crashing pandemonium that sent
everyone's heart to his mouth. A shell had
struck the roof. Then the ceiling above
bulged like a stuffed sack and burst in a
cloud of pink-yellow dust. Something
dropped with a dead thud fair and square in
the centre of the fine oak refectory table.
Sergeant Stansfield bent forward, looked,
and then started back. He gave a cry and
turned sickly white. On the table lay <i>the
little huddled form of Boudru</i>. The morning
sun that had been paling the candles in the
sconces, struck the golden hair and staring
eyes, that had a few hours before, held all
the spring-time; struck, too, a heavy scarlet
patch on the little overall, as the sergeant
tenderly turned the little body over....</p>

<p>"Oh! God of Mercy!... How horrible!
A bayonet through his heart ..." he
muttered. The Hun's sleeve spotted with
blood came back to his mind, and filled him
with blind, unreasoning rage.</p>

<p>"You swine," he said. "I'll&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>The man from Stettin suddenly felt his
heart stop beating. He stood petrified for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
a moment; then he clutched the table with
one feverish movement; and when he saw
the pale cherub face, he became covered at
once with perspiration. Then the terror,
which had paralyzed him a second or so,
gave way to the wild instinct of self-preservation.
He hit out wildly with both arms,
kicking out at the same moment. In a
second he was out in the hall, and had locked
the door behind him. A door opened somewhere
outside, and they heard him running
down the garden. Some of the men snatched
their rifles, rushed to the window, and threw
it open. Four or five shots rang out simultaneously,
and the stench of cordite was
wafted back on the sharp morning air as the
man from Stettin fell in a crumpled heap, his
face buried in a clump of violets. The
sergeant went into the garden.</p>

<p>"Hum!" he remarked after an instant,
"dead, did you say? He's as dead as a doornail ... anyway,
it's nothing to do with
us! If ever a soul went straight to hell,"
he muttered to himself, "it was that red
devil's."</p>

<h2>IV</h2>

<h3>THE STORY OF A SPY</h3>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Donald McNab</span>, private (and distinguished
ornament) of the London Regiment, leaned
his elbows on the little oak table in the bar
of the "Three Nuns," and eyed me with
withering contempt. From a corner of the
settle I stared&mdash;with a wholly unsuccessful
attempt to look unconcerned&mdash;at a quaint
old painting of Sergeant Broughton who first
taught Englishmen to box scientifically. When
the great are really wrathful it ill becomes
pigmy people to jabber or argue. So I
waited with bent head and respectful silence
to which the passing moods of such an erratic
genius are entitled.</p>

<p>When McNab and I had met an hour or so
before we had been on the most friendly terms.
We had both ordered our pint of beer, filled
our pipes, and retired to a corner in the bar
parlour feeling at peace with the world&mdash;barring
of course the German Empire and
their allied forces. Everything, in fact, made
for peace and goodwill between us; yet,
because I had spoken with some levity about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
our incomplete spy system, McNab's wrath
had come down on my head like the proverbial
"hundred of bricks."</p>

<p>"It seems strange," I had remarked to
him, "that the Huns can always forestall our
most carefully-prepared plans through their
almost perfect spy system. Our fellows must
be dead stupid at the game. Why aren't
these German vipers ever nabbed?"</p>

<p>"Dead stupid!" McNab had exclaimed,
after gazing at me for a minute in dazed
stupefaction at my unspeakable temerity in
challenging the proficiency of the British
Army. "Get under your Blanco pot!"</p>

<p>Now, when McNab used this picturesque
term to me I knew that there was a storm
brewing. He only used the expression when
he wished to be particularly "cutting," and
I received his reproof with, I hope, a correct
realisation of my own insignificance.</p>

<p>The old world had rolled along for another
twenty minutes ere McNab shifted his legs,
cleared his throat, and interfered with what
was left in his tankard.</p>

<p>"I wonder," he said musingly to himself,
"if these poor yobs over here will ever know
the true 'istory of this bloomin' war?"
Then back came a smile to his face and he
shook his head, indicating, perhaps, that he
had answered the question to his complete
satisfaction. The joyousness at the thought
of some of those unrecorded slices of military
history caused my friend to drop again into<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
a contemplative mood, and he started humming
a little tune under his breath:</p>

<div class="poem" style="width: 19em;">
<span class="i0">Hello! Hello! who's your lady friend?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who's the little girlie by your side?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've seen you with a girl or two,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, oh, oh, I <span class="smcapl">AM</span> surprised at you!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hello! Hello! what's your little game?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Don't you think it's time your ways to mend?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That's not the gal I saw you with at Brighton,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, oh, oh, who's your lady friend?<br /></span>
</div>

<p>"If it is not a rude question," I ventured,
after another few moments, "did you ever
see the capture of a German spy over in
France, Mr. McNab?"</p>

<p>"Who are you getting at ... trying to
pull my leg?" he demanded, with increased
suspicion.</p>

<p>"Come, come," I laughed, "let us agree
to differ about our&mdash;er&mdash;inferior spy
system."</p>

<p>"Superior," he insisted.</p>

<p>I surrendered before the gleam of his eye.
Fool that I had been, ever to have imagined
that I could conquer McNab's steely glance!</p>

<p>"Superior then, if you prefer it."</p>

<p>McNab's eyes, which had glared with indignation,
lost their fire and assumed their
normal expression of calm and relentless
despotism, and the red flag of agitated displeasure
disappeared from his tanned face.
He seized with alacrity the olive branch (also
another tankard of beer) which I held out to
him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>

<p>"The history of the British Army," he
observed as he blew at his ale "'minds me of
a married soldier's letter to his wife. The
most interesting parts are all left out ... do
you get me?"</p>

<p>McNab tilted his hat at a perilous angle
on one side of his head, and thrust his hands
deep into his pockets.</p>

<p>"Touching upon some of those unwritten
exploits of the Army," I darkly hinted:
"I'll bet I can find a brilliant historiographer
not a hundred miles away from the 'Three
Nuns' who could dictate a few of 'em that
would fairly make the <i>Daily Mail</i> turn green
with envy&mdash;eh, McNab?"</p>

<p>"I know the brilliant bloke you mean,"
my friend conceded modestly, "though calling
me 'orrible names like that would brand you
as a swanker or a gentleman wot had left his
manners in the hall in any barrack room
from here to Hindustan. When we were
resting at Quality Street near Loos, for
example"&mdash;he paused a moment, and with a
playful dig from his banana-like thumb nearly
knocked me on the floor&mdash;"why, name of a
dog! There you have a case in point!"</p>

<p>"A case of a swanker?"</p>

<p>"A case of one of those spies. We caught
the perisher. Begad, we did!"</p>

<p>McNab put the red-hot end of a cigarette
into his mouth, stammered with wrath in a
medley of international profanity at the
unexpected warmth, and would not be comforted<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
till his favourite barmaid had placed
a slice of cooling lemon on his tongue.</p>

<p>"My first introduction to the entertaining
sport of spy tracking," he mumbled, "was at
Loos, where I was sent with several hundred
other chaps to help push the Huns out of
the Hohenzollern Redoubt. At the present
moment, as you know (or ought to by this
time), I am a military genius 'ighly thought of
at the War Office, a strategist Kitchener has
his eye on, and a model soldier quoted every
day by my colonel as a shining light to the
regiment. But of course you must remember
that a few months ago I was practically a
yob at the game, and now of the fame (and
the extreme shyness that seems to come with
it) of my later avatar.</p>

<p>"We took over some temporary billets
at a shady little spot not far behind the
British trenches which was then known as
'Quality Street,'" he continued, "and, as I
not unreasonably supposed that the smartest
and most intelligent bloke in the regiment
would be sent to 'elp the colonel, I requested
the Dog's Leg (Anglice&mdash;lance-corporal) to
point out his abode to me.</p>

<p>"'Ask the Quarter Bloke over along in the
end cottage, old sport,' he said with a grin,
'he'll be most 'appy, I've no doubt to personally
conduct to the old pot-an-pan, and
while you're there just ask him to let you
have that jug of defaulters' extra milk for
me.' It was a 'wheeze' among the boys to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
send a poor innocent bloke off for this milk.
The point of the 'wheeze' is in the fact
that as defaulters are chaps doing jankers
(Anglice&mdash;punishment) they are hardly likely
to get any extra milk dished out to them. I
did not see the joke at first; but on application
to that autocratic beggar&mdash;Quartermaster
King was his tally&mdash;he fully explained
things to me in that witheringly sarcastic
manner peculiar to sergeant-majors and
quarter-blokes.</p>

<p>"'Defaulter's milk?' echoed he. 'Why,
you lop-eared leper, you've got corpuscular
fool wrote as plain as a motor lorry number
all over your ugly face. If I wasn't sure that
you was not more of a born idiot than a
ruddy knave, etc., etc., etc., I would have
you slick in mush before your feet could
touch the ground!'</p>

<p>"Much crest-fallen, and terribly mortified, I
returned to the cottage which had been selected
to shelter me noble self, only to be met there
with a volley of derisive laughter, repeated
demands for the jug of Defaulter's milk, and
questions about the quarter bloke's health.</p>

<p>"'A cat may look at a <i>King</i>,' said the Dog's
Leg, and fell backwards out of the open
window at his own joke, breaking 'is collar
bone. One should never forget, at every time,
as the Scriptures say, that pride allus goes
before a fall, and that all the King's 'orses
and all the King's men can't not even pick
'im up again!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span></p>

<p>My murmured compliments on his amazing
aptness in the knowledge of Holy Writ were
checked by a sudden discovery that my best
silver cigarette case had vanished from the
table.</p>

<p>"Which of you civilians has stole the
gentleman's silver case?"</p>

<p>This question, uttered not in the friendliest
possible terms, was addressed to a young
gentleman with a very pimply face, and
kaleidoscopic coloured socks, of the genus
Slacker, who had suddenly found the painting
of Sergeant Broughton an object of absorbing
interest.</p>

<p>This inquiry meeting with no response
from the Slimy Slacker, (to use McNab's
expressive name for him), he gave utterance
to a sigh of resignation.</p>

<p>"I believe, sir," suggested an old gentleman
who was warming his toes at the fire,
"that you deposited the gentleman's cigarette
case&mdash;er&mdash;inadvertently in your own pocket!"</p>

<p>"Why, strike me crimson!" cried McNab,
diving his beef-steakish hands into his tunic
pockets. "Why, so I did! I'm the biggest
giddy fool at that kind of wheeze that ever
lived. It's a knock-out, ain't it? Never
mind&mdash;'<i>honi soit qui mal y</i> eighteen pence,'
as the French poet bloke said!</p>

<p>"It so happened that on the very next
day our old man's servant went sick, and in
spite of my extreme youth and innocence,
I was selected from the crowd to fill the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
vacant billet. And then it was that the
Colonel realised that fate had dropped a
heaven-sent blessing on his knees in the
shape of a&mdash;well, in the shape of an ingenious
bloke like me. He lifted up his voice in
thanksgiving for that the British Army held
warriors so wise, and then looked up his
whiskey and cigars.</p>

<p>"At one end of Quality Street there stood a
Y.M.C.A. hut. On the next day when I
pushed the door of this Bun-Wallah's paradise
open, the first person I saw was old Tommy&mdash;Tommy
wot had fought up and down the Godforsaken
veldt with me for three years on
end, Tommy who had always the knack of
droppin' out of the blue from nowhere.</p>

<p>"'Well, 'ere's a go!' he cried dropping
half a cup of boiling coffee down another
chap's neck, as 'is smile broadened, 'it's a 'ell
of a time since I struck you.'</p>

<p>"I saw the dawn of recognition on his
ugly mug; and I could have guessed to a
word the joyful expressions of welcome that
were springing to his lips."</p>

<p>McNab paused.</p>

<p>"Quite so," I prompted, seeing the change
that took place in my friend's face.</p>

<p>"I am afraid I should have guessed dead
wrong," continued McNab with his eyes
downcast. "However, what he did spit out
was: 'strike me up a gum-tree if it ain't
the bloke what borrowed 'alf a crown off me
when I was quartered at the "Shot" in '98.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>"I was pretty well worked up at this
remark; but I said to him with quiet dignity:
'I believe, Tommy, that I sent it back by
post.'</p>

<p>"'You sent me back a threepenny bit,' he
says, with a very naughty word, 'and told
me it was my 'alf crown worn down.'</p>

<p>"'Come, come, old chum!' I laughed, 'let
us forget all about that, such a thing is really
only "very small beer" indeed.'</p>

<p>"'Humph!' grunted Tommy. 'It was
a blighted small 'alf crown, too.'</p>

<p>"'Sit down,' he continued, clutching me
by the wrist and dragging me into a vacant
chair. It was not in champagne, of course,
that we drank each other's health. But you
can always trust old Tommy to have a little
pig's ear hidden somewhere. 'What's the
matter with a bottle of Bass?' says he to me.
''Tis against ole Kitchener's wishes,' says
I. 'Of course it is,' says Tommy; 'and
wot is more, it's the ruin of dear ole England&mdash;God
bless it!' 'Rot yar innards&mdash;let's go
and 'ave some,' I says bein' always one to
reason out matters to a logical conclusion.</p>

<p>"There is a large slag heap in the neighbourhood
of Quality Street where the French
and Germans met early in the war. They
wanted each other's company exclusive on
this here heap. Well, they met, and fell to
arguin' whether the French should 'ave it
as a mounting for a few machine-guns or the
Germans should keep it for sniping purposes.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
Hence the air was soon clouded with
shells, shrapnel, and all other deadly diseases.
Seeing the children had got over their shyness
in this little fright and had really played
quite a good game, this particular slag heap
was bearing abundant fruit in the way of
trophies. Furthermore, Tommy suggested
that it would be indeed nice if we could make
our way there one evening and collect a few
German helmets, bayonets, and other curiosities
for the old people at home.</p>

<p>"As a result of our confabulation we found
ourselves about ten that night crawling up
a hedge towards the slag heap in question.
When we did get there we went and lost our
blighted selves. How long we were crawling
and twisting about that Gawd-forsaken heap
or which way our lines lay I'd no means of
knowing. But poor old Tommy rolled down
a bank with an armful of German helmets
and other trophies, making a noise like a fire
engine galloping up the Mile End Road.
Then suddenly one of those German flares
fell on the ground about a hundred yards
away, and all things, including Tommy and
I, shone out in their naked splendour. Then
you can take it from me we <i>did</i> see where
we were.</p>

<p>"I thought Tommy was having a bad
attack of epileptic fits for a moment, till it
transpired that he had flumped down on a
dead Boche in endeavouring to escape the
searching glare of the flare. After the thing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
had burnt its giddy self out Tommy crawled
crab-fashion over into the providential cutting
in which I had taken shelter. He was wiping
his forehead with the back of his hand, and
he looked very solemn and rather frightened.
'Did you spot that chap crouching in that
V-shaped cutting down there?' he said.
'I thought he was one of our old crowd at
first, but what with that cursed light and the
excitement I could not be certain.'</p>

<p>"'I saw nothing.'</p>

<p>"'Just before the flare went up I noticed
a flash lamp; one of those things used to
give signals with. I got an awful turn then.'</p>

<p>"'Rot,' I said: 'I don't believe a word
of it.'</p>

<p>"'Do you mind coming over this way then?'
said Tommy.</p>

<p>"In the pitch-black darkness, guided by
Tommy, I stumbled up a path which I'll
swear was all of a one in three gradient. We
came out upon a little ledge overlooking what
we now knew to be the German lines. Tommy
motioned me to keep my eye on the V-shaped
cutting in the slag below us.</p>

<p>"'I think the beggar is down in the extreme
angle of the V,' he whispered as he crawled
beside me.</p>

<p>"Then I overbalanced, fell over the ridge,
and dropped clean on to something soft and
yielding below. Red specks dotted the blackness
before my eyes for a few moments as
I bounced on the hard stones. I jumped up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
with a jerk and spun round to find, blocking
my path, a menacing figure regarding me
over the barrel of a Browning pistol. In the
other hand he held an electric torch.</p>

<p>"'Don't move,' he said in good English.</p>

<p>"His tone was quiet and crisp, an' his face
showed me that 'e was out for blood.</p>

<p>"'I have it in my mind almost to be sorry
for you, British Tommy,' he said calmly,
'You know too much. I am going to decide
on the best way to dis&mdash;&mdash;'</p>

<p>"He got as far as 'dis'&mdash;when something
leaped out of the shadows and he was hurled
back with a sudden rush. It was Tommy,
and he swung his heavy Boche rifle and
stove the man down with terrific force.
There was a dreadful half-choked, whimper
and then silence.</p>

<p>"Tommy stood regarding the still form with
a bleached face. He then bent over him, but
without touching, looked up at me.</p>

<p>"'Saved a firing party the trouble,' he
said. 'He's dead all right.'</p>

<p>"He straightened himself up.</p>

<p>"'What the devil shall we do with it,
McNab?'</p>

<p>"''Tis a spy he was,' I answered, 'and
it's ten to one that he has a code or some
kind of papers tucked away on him. Just
run through his pockets before we leave him.'</p>

<p>"'No, no,' Tommy said, 'I can't touch
him he'll haunt me, sure.'</p>

<p>"The man was quite dead when I rolled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
him over. I took from his pockets a leather
bound code book, English, French and German
bank notes, and a gold stop watch.</p>

<p>"'No good stayin' here,' said Tommy, 'I
vote we crawl back and talk it over. This
is a crummy old place.'</p>

<p>"When we got back to billets and examined
our loot, it was a sure enough German spy's
code book, and it contained a rough sketch
of all our trenches and what not, quite
sufficient to use in conjunction with the
squared map he carried. The book was
printed in German.</p>

<p>"'You know,' said Tommy, 'we must
report this to the Colonel as soon as we can.'</p>

<p>"'An' be collared for being out at night
without a pass first thing? Not much,' said
I.</p>

<p>"'We must hide this loot. They may
search us when they find him out there,' said
Tommy, looking to the future.</p>

<p>"'Hide away, then,' I said, but my mind
was elsewhere, for all of a sudden, I had been
hit in the eye with a brilliant inspiration.</p>

<p>"The following morning, when I took our
ole man his early tea, I found 'im sitting up in
bed sucking a fat cigar and bewilderin' himself
with the brigade orders.</p>

<p>"'I beg your pardon, sir!' I says, 'but
may I have a word with you?'</p>

<p>"'You know, McNab,' he says, screwing
his eye-glass into his eye with a smile&mdash;'you
know that I am at any hour of the day or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
night glad to have a talk to a man of understanding
like yourself.'</p>

<p>"'That's good of you, Colonel,' I says,
'to meet me with such kindness. But I
think, as you say, that I have just a little
more than the usual share of intellec' under
my hat, but what I have come to lay before
your notice is this: I have discovered why
the Boche guns always register on our artillery
positions the moment they are taken up, and
the source of the leakage of information.'</p>

<p>"'Oh, you have, have you?' says he.</p>

<p>"''Tis a spy, sir,' says I, 'and it's signalling
to the Huns he was when I caught
him.'</p>

<p>"'Another blessed spy legend,' he yawned,
'I really thought that you, McNab, would be
the last man to become afflicted with the spy
craze. I have arrested half a dozen so-called
spies this week already only to find they were
harmless rustics&mdash;'</p>

<p>"'I beg your pardon, Colonel,' I returns,
with that chilling dignity which has at times
even made generals falter, 'but there is no
legend about Private McNab's spy.'</p>

<p>"'Then trot out your spy,' he says, 'and
I'll come and look 'im over.'</p>

<p>"'I not only caught him red-handed at his
nefarious trafficking (them was the very
words I used) ... I not only caught the
blighter, but I put his light out.'</p>

<p>"'What?' he shouts, clutching my arm,
'you killed the poor brute.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>"'<i>We</i> did&mdash;me and Tommy, and we found
this here code in his fob,' said I.</p>

<p>"With that I threw the little code book on
the bed, and the old man, after looking through
it carefully (he could read German, our old
man), got out of bed and started dressing in
a businesslike way.</p>

<p>"'Shut that door, McNab,' says he, 'and
let me have the benefit of your invaluable
advice.'</p>

<p>"All of a sudden I was struck with a brilliant
inspiration, and I let the old Colonel have it
for what it was worth.</p>

<p>"As it happened the old man thought a
mighty lot of it&mdash;such a lot, in fact, that by
one o'clock that day he started to imagine
the inspiration had come from his own fertile
brain. He liked to think that it was his, and,
Lord bless 'im, I don't grudge him the
glory.</p>

<p>"After laying our heads together, the
Colonel went back to the artillery lines and
spent three hours talking to the Battery
Major, and I looted a dozen three-pounder
rockets of var-i-ous colours out of the stores.
In the afternoon the Colonel called all his
officers together, and kept the blighted motorcycle
dispatch riders busy buzzing up and
down the line with messages, till late in the
evening.</p>

<p>"'I have called you gentlemen together,'
he says to his officer, 'in order to ask you to
corporate with me. I shall fire some rockets<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
from the slag heap to-night about ten o'clock.
On the first of these signals the Germans will
open a very heavy cannonade on our trenches.
I'll trouble you to have your men all in the
dug-outs, and under cover at a quarter to
ten!'</p>

<p>"That night, soon after the Colonel, Tommy
and I started off for the slag heap in the dark,
taking with us a bundle of rockets. My
idea was at last going to be tested&mdash;what do
you think it was, Sir?"</p>

<p>I discreetly pretended my utter inability to
guess.</p>

<p>"Why, nothing more or less than to hoist
these German blokes with their own petard,
so to speak. We were going to fool them by
giving them signals in their own code. Well,
after stumbling and groping about for half
an hour," McNab continued, "we arrived at
the spot near where we had overlooked the
spy.</p>

<p>"'I think this is the ledge from which I
fell,' Tommy whispered as we crawled on.
The next instant the Colonel disappeared,
and the little procession came to an abrupt
standstill. A crashing noise was heard as
the old man with a quarter of a ton of slag
went tobogganing down the stone-shod slope.</p>

<p>"'This <i>is</i> the spot,' Tommy said tersely.
And up to us came hoarse whispered curses as
our ole man tongue-lashed us for a full minute
in gross and detail.</p>

<p>"'Lie quite still, Colonel,' I whispered,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
'the Hun swine-dogs may send up a flare
if they hear us.'</p>

<p>"But no flare flared, and no sniper sniped.</p>

<p>"'This game gives me the blooming creeps,'
old Tommy muttered shudderingly, thinking
of Huns and guns three miles deep all round.
After that the Colonel struggled clear of the
'alf ton of slag atop o' him. Tommy and I
wandered a little more until we got down to
the old man. Here we halted. 'Here's the
place where we left the dead spy,' said
Tommy, his eyes peering into the darkness
of the V-shaped cutting. 'I can still see
Fritz lying in the corner. We had better get
right over <i>this</i> side. Come on!'</p>

<p>"'I see,' said the Colonel. 'This is the
key of the position. It overlooks the German
trenches and when the spy was using his
flash lamp he could not be observed by the
men in our lines.'</p>

<p>"'Good thing we short-circuited his little
game,' reflected Tommy hugging an arm full
of rockets.</p>

<p>"'Ah!' says he, fingering the electric
torch. 'How this game of war makes one
think. My 'orizon has indeed broadened.
Just to think that a few flashes from this
little chap will mean more than all those
glittering stars above to the German fellows
in the trenches over there. It's simply
ridiculous to waste our little concert on a
few Huns in the trenches to-night. We
must socialise the whole blooming show.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
We must get the head up of all the Huns for
miles around. Let us consult the code book,'
he said, and then opening it he read out some
of the rocket codes. They all seemed simple
enough. But he had some difficulty in finding
the one he wanted, having first of all of course
to translate them into English; but presently
he seized upon the one he wanted, he repeated
it over with delight:</p>

<p>"'<i>Two green rockets in rapid succession
mean: "Enemy making active preparations for
offensive movement" and when followed after a
suitable interval by a single red rocket, mean:
"Enemy will attack without delay."</i>'</p>

<p>"'Touch off two green rockets, McNab, if
you please,' said the Colonel with a tremor
in his voice.</p>

<p>"I touched off two three-pounders which rose
several thousand yards, and burst into bunches
of gorgeous stars. A faint clattering noise
came to us from the Hun trenches, and we all
hugged the earth fairly closely as a rapid
fusillade broke out from all quarters. Rifles
cracked all around us to the extent of thousands,
and with that a most impressive humming
noise, which I had never had the
pleasure of hearing before, because being a
soldier I had always formed a part of it&mdash;the
noise of whole armies turning out to meet
an attack.</p>

<p>"'Colonel,' I says, 'it may have escaped
you that the angry and 'ighly intelligent
Boche on our front will soon be sending up<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
<i>their</i> rockets to confuse our own men. Might
I recommend a red rocket before they open
their part of the ball, and bend the lights!
That will spell to 'em: Enemy will attack
without delay, and it will also expedite their
artillery just a leetle.'</p>

<p>"The Colonel laid his hand on my shoulder.</p>

<p>"'McNab,' says he, 'there's worse blokes
than you sitting on thrones. They shall 'ave
that red rocket. None the less,' he remarked,
'the situation is undeniably getting a bit
feverish. Trot out Red Rufus!'</p>

<p>"I rightly took the command to read:</p>

<p>"'Send up a red rocket.' Rufus soared
up into the sky and burst into a red glare that
simply shouted: 'Here they come after
you' to the Huns.</p>

<p>"'Oh-h-h-h-h!' exclaimed old Tommy as
the twirly-whirly red stars fell through the
sky.</p>

<p>"'Silence!' said the old man. 'This is
the sanguinary British Expeditionary Force,
not a (decorated) Brock's Benefit at the
Crystal Palace. What in Hong-Kong are you
jumping about like a richly decorated organ-grinder's
monkey for?'</p>

<p>"The Huns grasped the meaning of their
dead spy's signal as soon as it showed in the
heavens, so to speak. We lay belly-flat and
held our breaths for a moment or so in silence,
but we were about the only silent things for
a hundred miles. Flares went up by the
thousand and searchlights cut up the sky in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
every direction. All kinds of mysterious
guns got into action and all the batteries for
a hundred miles must have let drive as well.
From then on, for at least two hours, the
shells poured excruciating-wise into our deserted
trenches without cessation,&mdash;shrapnel,
high explosive, six inch, twelve inch&mdash;thousands
of pounds the Huns wasted that night.</p>

<p>"I wish you could have seen Tommy bowing
to right and left of the German trenches acknowledging
the applause which the Huns
would have given him if they'd known the
facts. On the other hand, as the Colonel
observed, they might 'ave killed him.</p>

<p>"'They'll have to pull up their socks at
Krupp's to replace the shells they have blazed
away in this little pantomime,' said Tommy
pressing his hands to his sides. 'Star programme&mdash;heap
big star programme! Phew!
Oh, I wish I could stop laughing, I ain't 'ad
such a laugh for years!'</p>

<p>"'And in this little code book here,' said
the old man, a hand on each of our shoulders,
'there are hundreds of little love messages
we can be getting ready to surprise 'em with.
Presently we'll begin to send 'em instructions
to concentrate their fire on empty houses&mdash;tell
'em they are chock-full of British troops.
Then they'll fairly let loose the bow-yows of
war. Damme, how their gunners will gun!
Oblige me by thinking of four hundred guns,
pumping val-u-able shells into an empty
house.'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"The exquisite humour of it brought us
down screaming with laughter in a tangle on
the slag-heap. A searchlight broke out from
the back of the Hun trenches and began
searching our lines.</p>

<p>"'They're looking for our attacking party,
or the Angels of Mons,' panted the old man,
his knees in a shell hole and his face in the
grass. 'Well, let's get our things packed and
hurry back. I think they have sent back for a
fresh supply of shells. The sooner we get out
of it the better. Sufficient unto the day&mdash;or
night, perhaps one should say.'</p>

<p>"Well, it's dry work talking," said McNab,
wistfully surveying the interior of his empty
mug.</p>

<p>I took measures&mdash;pint measures&mdash;to allay
his thirst.</p>

<p>"Let me see now," he said; "let me see."</p>

<p>"And did you do any signalling with the
flash lamp the next night?" I timidly hinted,
"I believe you mentioned that it was your
intention."</p>

<p>"Yes, we did have some fun, I can tell
you, and 'twas better still next night. Once
more we returned, to the slag-heap, then,"
McNab swept on, "we started to flash a few
messages over to the German lines. They
soon picked up our signals and after a brief
interrogation they replied. Then they started
to ask questions. 'At which part of the
British line would it be wise to launch an
attack?' they flashed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"And our old man flashed back a trench
that was fairly bristly with machine guns.
Then they asked other questions, but we did
not reply. We laid low and said nothing,
for you can take it from me, mister, that a
real spy is a man of few words, and playing
with a flashlight in enemy lines is not exactly
a healthy game.</p>

<p>"Had we have signalled too freely the
Huns would have soon become suspicious, for,
mark you, the flares that we had popped off
at 'em the night before had left 'em with an
uncomfortable feeling that their spy was
taking quite unreasonable risks. It is of
course most unusual for a spy to make use of
rocket signals. Do I make myself comprehensible?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly. Did the Huns attack?" I asked.</p>

<p>McNab nodded. "They attacked us three
days afterwards at five o'clock in the morning.
It was like a nightmare. The Germans came
on, evidently thinking they were on a soft
job, and you can realize what a wonderful
target they made for the gunners who had
been waiting for 'em. Such a target that
gunners dream about but never see. We had
some eighteen-and-a-'arf-pounders not five
hundred yards away, and they let go right
into the thick of 'em. And each case shot
with its four hundred bullets swept and tore
their ranks. With a mighty gasp and something
like a groan the Huns staggered, recovered,
and with wild yells came charging<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
on to a hundred machine guns. And all the
time the shells came over at them and tore
wide swathes in their closely-packed ranks.
Then our boys got into 'em and swept the
remaining Huns into eternity!"</p>

<p>"Unless this story had come from such a
highly-reliable fountain-head, McNab," I murmured,
after a moment or so, "I would never
have believed that the whole thing was not a
fabrication."</p>

<p>McNab removed his pot of beer on one side,
and leaned across the table. I moved my
chair back quickly, just missing another
vigorous stab from his huge index-finger.</p>

<p>"The history of this war," he observed
impressively, "will be interwoven with extraordinary
things like this 'ere tale I have been
telling you. And you may lay to it, mister,
that the most extraordinary things of all will
never see the light of day in the printed
page."</p>

<p>"I can <i>quite</i> understand that," I said
pointedly; "for, although a student of
military history of this war myself, I cannot
recall a single reference to any of the remarkable
events which occurred in the trenches
during the eight months you were with your
regiment over there!"</p>

<p>McNab regarded me for a full minute with
rapidly-rising choler. Then he shifted his
stare from me to an old gentleman who was
warming his toes at the fire.</p>

<p>"The yarn I have told you is as true as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
the drill book, though you need not believe
it if you have conscientious objections. I
have been recounting real slices of history.
Leastways, when I say history I may be
wrong, because they will never appear in
history. But they <i>'appened</i>, Mister&mdash;'appened
as surely as I am sitting here with an empty
pot in front o' me. An'&mdash;an'&mdash;&mdash;" McNab
stammered in his excitement&mdash;"if any bloke
says they didn't, be jabers, I'll&mdash;I'll drink his
beer!"</p>

<p>But neither the old gentleman nor any
member of the company wished to disagree
with him, and he rose up from the chair with
a mug to order his final half-pint. He returned
(a trifle unsteadily, perhaps) with his
beer and a particularly vile cigar in his mouth.
Whether it was the effect of the heat or the&mdash;er&mdash;beer
I cannot say, but he blundered over
my legs, causing me a sharp twinge of pain.</p>

<p>"What an awkward beggar you are that
you can't see to walk straight," I said.</p>

<p>McNab looked down at my legs after giving
them another stirring up with his foot.
"Why, Go' bless my soul," he said, "it's quite
true, I am an awkward devil. I certainly
should have seen <i>those</i> feet. However did
you get 'em into the bar?"</p>

<p class="noin"><span class="smcap">Hilaire O'Hagan</span> sat in the September sunshine
on the grass that skirted the roadside.
For some time he had been examining with
a stare of melancholy interest the worn toes
of his boots. On his head was a dingy straw
hat; to his form and limbs there hung a faded
and creased coat and a pair of shiny black
trousers;&mdash;he held in his hand five shillings
which had been thrust into his hand when
the prison gates had opened to him that
morning. He had taken the money and
swaggered out with a parting gibe at the
constable who closed the doors behind him.</p>

<p>O'Hagan was an incorrigible rascal. Some
years before, when he stood in the Assize
Court, a venerable judge had told him so.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
"O'Hagan," said the judge grimly, "you
are what I should term an incorrigible rogue,
and I shall send you to prison for two years
with hard labour. You have run across my
path many times before. When you gain
your liberty it will be very much to your
advantage if you keep out of my way for good
and all."</p>

<p>O'Hagan had received the sentence with the
same impertinent smirk on his face as he
had received many similar sentences.</p>

<p>Now he was a free man. He was powerful,
full of health, and&mdash;lazy. He reflected
aloud, with evident enjoyment (and in the
speech of a lettered gentleman), "This is
indeed one of those days when it is good to
be alive!"</p>

<p>"O'Hagan!" came a sudden voice, harsh
and authoritative, from behind him: He
rose to his feet and faced about. In the
roadway appeared the constable to whom he
had addressed some not over polite remarks
on his way out of prison.</p>

<p>"Well?" said O'Hagan.</p>

<p>The constable snorted. "Didn't you hear
me tell you to move on? We don't want any
habitual criminals hanging about here."</p>

<p>O'Hagan dived his hands deep into the
pockets of his shiny trousers and slouched
along towards the next village. About a
mile ahead was an inn he knew of where he
might enjoy a great refreshment, and drink
the waters of Lethe. He jingled the silver<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
in his pocket and reflected that for one night
at least he could eat strongly, and drink
largely, and sleep deeply.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>Outside a house screened by a mysterious
ten foot wall full of the plain dignity of unpretending
age, a long grey motor car was
standing. O'Hagan turned and surveyed it,
and his quick eye rested upon a leather hand
case on a rug beneath the seat. It did not
take him a moment to snatch it and hide it
swiftly beneath his coat. For a second or so
he stood back against the wall. At that
moment a girl came out of the house, in
company with an elderly gentleman, and
walked towards the car. O'Hagan looked
at the girl swiftly. At the same time she
glanced at him, and their eyes met. Things
looked unhealthy for O'Hagan. But fate
was altogether with him, and the motor
moved off and left him standing there with
the case under his coat. No glorious figure,
this man, but one of those whom specialists
now place amongst the doomed as cursed
with the criminal instinct, with the vices that
require lavish means to feed them&mdash;a man
who only feels a thrill in life when he is
preying on his fellows, or eluding the hand of
justice.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>O'Hagan walked down the road a little<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
way with his hand resting lovingly on the
leather case. He turned a corner, cut through
the hedge, and took a track across a field.
In the shelter of a clump of bushes he sat
leisurely on the grass and went over the contents.
Among the various odds and ends was
a leather purse. He opened it with trembling
fingers. There was a sovereign, five one
pound notes folded up, eight shillings in
silver, and a small silver cross hanging on a
black silk riband. He dropped the silver with
a sigh of satisfaction into his trousers pocket,
and the notes he stored in the lining of his
hat. He took up the little cross and was
about to thrust it into the thick grass,
when he paused for a moment, and was
aware of an oppressive feeling.</p>

<div class="poem">
<span class="i0">On a sudden, in the midst of men and day,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And while he sat and looked around,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He seemed to be in a bygone age,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And feel himself the shadow of a dream.<br /></span>
</div>

<p>O'Hagan felt that his body was decreasing,
sinking under the green turf, falling down,
down, down, and yet "He" was still above,
gazing, wondering, open-eyed, open-mouthed,
as it were. Gradually, but none the less
surely, he was being crowded round by many
moving "?'s" which never seemed to grow
distinct. He seemed to know at once he was
back in the days long past. He shut his eyes
against a burning that felt like tears. When
he opened them again he was looking at his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
own name, fairly carved in on the silver cross
in quaint old English letters:</p>

<div class="figc">
<img src="images/001.png" width="159" height="22" alt="Hilaire O'Hagan" title="" />
</div>

<p>The clump of bushes before him was now
obscured by a thin white cloud. As he
watched he was aware of a figure that stood
out distinctly before him. He was a man of
his own height, thick-set, serious-looking, in
a monk's mantle and hood. O'Hagan gave
a hurried glance, and as hurriedly turned his
head away again. The face of the man
exactly resembled his own. But it was an
honest face, without the look of dissipation,
and the secret furtive air, which he knew
marred his own features. He also thought
he could see a faint nimbus round his head&mdash;but
this may have been illusion. O'Hagan
moved away as if he had no wish to see him;
but the stranger was not to be put off by any
such trick. He touched O'Hagan's arm, and
brought him to a standstill.</p>

<p>"Brother!" he said in a gentle
voice.</p>

<p>O'Hagan pulled himself up sharply. For a
moment it seemed as if he would have refused
to stay, but the next he realized that it would
be of no use.</p>

<p>"What do you want with me?" he began.
"I know I'm a thief and a drunkard. Do
you want to hand me a Sunday School tract?
If so get it over."</p>

<p>The stranger's hand tightened on his arm,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
and he began to speak in a calm but strangely
thrilling voice. "It is written there: '<i>men
do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his
soul when he is hungry.</i>'"</p>

<p>"Well?" said O'Hagan, trying to hold a
countenance of little concern.</p>

<p>"Well?" said the stranger, "for why did
you steal?"</p>

<p>O'Hagan coughed and held down his head.</p>

<p>"A man without scruple and without
heart," the stranger remarked to himself.</p>

<p>O'Hagan looked up with a start. "Look
here," he began. "You've no right to&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Then of a sudden the mist began to rise
from the clump of bushes and the stranger
vanished. O'Hagan was back in the flesh.
He stood there dazed for the moment, with
the little cross clutched in his hand. He sat
down again and <i>tried</i> to force his spirit back
to the other scene, but in vain. He felt that
he had been thrilled through and through.
The oppression, however, unlike the stern-faced
monk, did not vanish, it deepened. A
throbbing headache came on, which refused
to be shaken off, and eventually sent O'Hagan
to the "Bell Inn" to drink still deeper of the
waters of oblivion.</p>

<p>The day was already falling when he walked,
jingling his silver, into the sanded bar of the
"Bell Inn," and an hour or so later, when it
began to fill with drovers and country folk,
O'Hagan had looked much on the good brown
ale. He was in fact becoming very noisy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
Seated in a corner, he sang "Nell and Roger
at the Wake" in a hoarse voice. The country
folk grinned and looked at him curiously.</p>

<p>"Shut your gab, old sport," said a rough-looking
drover at last, "that song is not fit for
decent folk to hear."</p>

<p>O'Hagan swore like any trooper, and
reached his hand out to a large spirit bottle
at his elbow, and for a moment the drover
thought he would get it thrown at his head.
However, O'Hagan rose to his feet, made a bow
to the company, and made an apology to
the drover. He stood there, a blackguard
on the face of him, but a gentleman in spite
of that undefinable and vaguely repulsive
smirk which played about his straight and
refined mouth. He slunk away into the
night.</p>

<p>As O'Hagan walked the night deepened in
throbs of gathering darkness. The sense of
uneasiness that had been with him ever
since the priest in the cassock had appeared to
him was not to be easily thrown off. He set
himself to argue down the uneasiness for
which there was no more foundation than a
bad attack of "nerves" after the gloomy
life in prison. He told himself, till he believed
it, that a man&mdash;just a human man&mdash;had been
crossing the fields, and that being smitten
with religious fervour he had quoted the
Scripture aloud, as he had often heard such
people do. He told himself it was mere
fancy that was the cause of the belief that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
something was <i>shining</i> around the man's
head. As he argued these things away, and
banished the face of his visitor, a certain sort
of reason usurped his place. But he did not
feel comfortable, however, he fell short of any
form of fear.</p>

<p>It was O'Hagan's whole business to find
desolate corners, where he could sleep without
the fear of interruption by the police; and hence
being in a part of the country that he knew
well, he bethought himself suddenly of the
great barn next to the mansion house at
Tilney St. Lawrence. It was always full of
good hay, as large as a barrack and no
thoroughfare passed within a quarter of a
mile of it. In such a place, and with the scent
of the hay to lull him, O'Hagan threw his
tired body down, and soon lost all the cares
of the world in complete repose.</p>

<p>All his life O'Hagan had been a habitual
dreamer; the nights were few, that is to say,
when on awakening he did not find that
some mental traffics and discoveries had been
his, and at times, the whole night through he
would meet with most dazzling adventures.
In prison his dreams had been a great solace
to him, and each night he had settled down
to devote the dark hours to the cultivation
of joyous dreams. He was one of those men
who went to sleep fair and square, and looked
for dreams. But as O'Hagan stretched in
the hay, things were revealed to him that
were beyond all dreams, and of course he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
could not keep the strange priest out of the
vision. It opened with finding himself in
front of the doors of an old church, where, he
understood, he was going to hide from someone
who wanted to kill him. He knocked on
the door and the man who opened the door
was the very priest he had seen in the afternoon.
He asked him to step in and instantly
turned round and walked up the dimly lit
aisle, and O'Hagan understood that he had to
follow. In silence they passed through a
small arch in the chancel and mounted a
narrow oak staircase with many corners and
tortuous turns and arrived at a small landing
with a studded door set in it. Quite inexplicably
O'Hagan's heart sank at the sight
of it. However, the priest unlocked and
opened it, and held it open for him to enter,
and without coming in himself, closed it. It
was a small oak room with a stone floor, and
a curious smell at once attracted his notice.
It was there&mdash;there, close to him&mdash;under his
very nose&mdash;the strong, acrid odour of decay&mdash;the
nauseating smell of the grave. Looking
about he saw the floor was paved with grave
stones. In one corner stood a fine seventeenth
century lead coffin. A curious greyish light
shone from it. O'Hagan's conjecture had
been right: there was something awful in the
room, and with the terror of nightmare seizing
him swiftly by the throat and throttling him,
he awoke in a spasm of terror. O'Hagan was
sitting bolt upright with the impression that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
someone had flashed a lantern in his face,
though the barn was absolutely pitch dark.
"I've had a most diabolical nightmare. It
was the drink," he said to himself, and decided
to go to sleep again. But the excessive heat
of the barn would let him rest no longer. The
atmosphere seemed to be hot and pungent,
and he groped about and opened the door to
let in some air. Almost at the same moment
someone cried "Fire!" and shapes of things
began to define in a soft grey glimmering;&mdash;and
the gloom was broken up by a red and
angry spurt of flame from a wing of the old
manor house. Again cries of "Fire!" came
to his ears, and grew and multiplied. O'Hagan
was fully awake in an instant, and running
at top speed towards the old mansion. When
he reached it the whole sky about was illuminated
by a red and angry light. Almost
at the moment of his arrival a tower of smoke
arose in front of the porch window, and with a
tingling report, a pane fell outwards at his
feet. A crowd of cowed and white-faced
country folk drew back when he rushed up.
Then he looked up at the porch window and
saw what it was that made the people go.
He saw a girl's terrified face at the window.
"The girl I lifted the bag from," he said
aloud. "She'll be burnt to death."</p>

<p>The heavy hall doors were surrounded by
the inmates of the house who had escaped and
O'Hagan pushed through them, and sprang
up the broad stairway mid choking volumes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
of smoke. When reached the room above
the porch the heat was fierce, and the roaring
of the fire filled his ears, and he had scarce
carried the terrified girl out of the room when
a side door fell in, and a branch of flame shot
brandishing through the aperture, and the
head of the stairs became lit up with a dreadful
and fluctuating glare. He carried her
swiftly down the stairs, he feared every
moment that they would crumple and fall in.
But he fought his way grimly, and his jerky
swear words were lost in the roaring of the
fire. Another moment and they were in the
open. Firelight and moonlight illuminating
the country around with confused and violent
lustre, and banked against the stars and the
sky they could see a glowing track of smoke.</p>

<p>"That was a near thing, Miss."</p>

<p>"I thought my end had come!" she said,
the colour returning slowly to her face.
"There would have been no chance at all if
you had not come up for me, as I was then
almost suffocated. It was a very brave
act!" She did not thank him&mdash;she couldn't
have spoken plain words of thanks to save her
life&mdash;but O'Hagan knew what she thought&mdash;"Don't
say any more about it, Miss, I am
really a coward at heart."</p>

<p>"I'm sure I owe my life to you," she said
earnestly. "I know there are some things
for which thanks are an insult, but you will
not mind if I offer you a little token of
gratitude?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span></p>

<p>O'Hagan's hand was resting on a small
silver cross in his pocket, and in another
moment he solemnly handed the girl the
money and notes he had stolen. "Why,
whatever is this?" asked the girl, staring at
O'Hagan in bewildered amazement.</p>

<p>"That's yours," he said by way of assistance.</p>

<p>"But I don't understand!" she cried,
greatly puzzled.</p>

<p>"Well, Miss, I suppose it does require
some elucidation," O'Hagan replied somewhat
nervously. "You see, it's only a return
of stolen goods. You remember visiting a
house in the big grey motor car yesterday,
Miss?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Well, I stole your bag from under the
seat. I have given you back again all that
I have left. But I will take this little cross
as a token." He dangled the little silver
charm before her face, and before she had
time to take in the situation O'Hagan had
disappeared.</p>

<hr class="min" />

<p>The long plains of Northern Europe
stretched before the gaze of a regiment of
British infantry&mdash;great undulations of sodden
earth left by the winter rains and thaws.
There, in the piercing cold that froze the feet,
they waited the signal to advance. Stray
bullets whined and pinged as they struck<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
the wire and sand bags on the top of the
trenches; occasionally a man fell on his
face; and the ghastly change in the faces of
the troops bore testimony to the effects.
Hilaire O'Hagan lay stretched upon his face,
occasionally looking towards his officer. His
heart beat like the pulsing of a motor car.
His throat felt dry, his cheeks were burning.
At times a cold shiver passed right through
his frame. He fidgeted and lolled from one
side, to the other. It seemed to him that he
had waited hours for the signal to get over
the trenches. He tried to strike a match for
his pipe; his hand was trembling furiously.
It occurred to him that after having passed
through the gory awfulness of six months'
incessant fighting, he was beginning to lose
his nerve. He was no longer master of himself.
He was afraid. Every man has the
instinct that prompts fear, for upon that
instinct the whole foundation of life-preservation
is founded. But over and above this
instinct, common to all of us, O'Hagan had
imagination&mdash;the graphic, vivid imagination
that always lurks in Irish blood. Is not the
entire history of the Celt a rejection of the
things of this world for the Shadow and the
dream? Upon this basis of fear and imagination
O'Hagan started to build, building and
building until he had created a grand structure
of blind terror which yielded a most exquisite
torture to his mind.</p>

<p>A whistle sounded and a shudder traversed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the men all down the trench. The officer
called to his men. He mounted the parapet
and jumped over. There was a sound like
the rushing of a river as the regiment poured
itself over the trench. The men advanced
slowly and dazedly. Now any acute observer
would note that the men were bewildered
and had little heart in the fight. Their faces
worked; and they struggled to walk on, but
it seemed useless. The bullets were pattering
all around and taking heavy toll. Then a
few yards in front a shrapnel shell kicked up
the mud. The German guns had found the
range. Someone shouted out the fatal words
"Lie down." The regiment was soon hugging
the earth, which was about the best thing
they could have done. Great showers of
shrapnel burst over them, and the bullets
struck down on them in a continuous shower.
Some men rose to their feet, and the shrapnel
withered them. Suddenly one shell burst
over O'Hagan, blotting out all around him
in smoke and dust, and brutally jerking his
mind to fullest tension. This shell fire was
hell! With the crash imagination and fear
began to work together in his overworked
brain&mdash;both at once in the queerest jumbling
manner. In a few moments O'Hagan was on
his feet running away&mdash;racing as if not merely
for his life, but his soul.</p>

<p>When O'Hagan's brain cooled and his
sight cleared he found himself in the doorway
of a little wrecked church. The German<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
shells had gashed and ripped the sides and
roof, so that birds flew in and out at will.
Hundreds of sparrows chirped in the oak
beams above. The shells had pitted, starred
and jerked up the blue flagstones in the porch
on which O'Hagan stood. Parts of the old
church had been shelled nearly level; little
twisted fragments of beautiful leaded windows
had been swept up in a pile outside with
other wreckage. As O'Hagan walked up the
aisle a feeling came over him that he knew
much of the old place. A quintessence and
distillation of peace and comradeship seemed
to inhabit the soft gloam of its chancel. He
found himself drifting back to past days and
seeing dimly in a thin white cloud faces that
seemed familiar and yet were unnameable.
Then one face stood out distinctly, and
O'Hagan watched it with breathless wonder
and fascination. He moved closer up to it;
he would have given much not to have done
so, but he could not help himself&mdash;he looked
closer, and it was&mdash;the face of the monk who
had appeared to him once before. When
the cloud had cleared a little, the outline of
the monk wearing a hood and cowl became
visible. Then was there a voice that he
identified at once despite the lapse of two
years since he had last heard it. "I have
been wanting to speak to you, brother, for
many hours, but <i>something</i> I cannot explain
to mortal man has prevented me." The
priest instantly turned round and O'Hagan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
understood that he meant him to follow. His
heart sank at once, and he experienced a sense
of dreadful oppression and foreboding, and
with a sudden thrill, partly of fear, and
partly of curiosity he followed. They passed
up the aisle and a perfectly familiar staircase.
Then he opened a door, and went in, and at
the same moment, sheer unreasoning terror
seized him. He was afraid, but did not know
why: he was simply afraid. Then like a
sudden recollection, when one remembers
some trivial adventure of childhood, O'Hagan
looked for the old lead coffin. He cast his
eyes about with a certain air of proprietorship,
and compared the room with the room
of his dreams. Nothing had changed. And
then, with a sudden start of unexplained
dread, he saw that the coffin was in the
corner&mdash;the same leaden coffin that he knew
so well with the same curious greyish light
coming from it. There was lettering on the
lid.</p>

<p>"What's written there? What's there?
Who's there?" he called. He called and
continued to call; then another terror, the
terror of the sound of his own voice seized
him; he did not dare to call again; he
whispered. There was something written on
the coffin that his mind reeled to entertain.
Without quite knowing how he came to be
there, O'Hagan found himself bending over
the coffin. He read the lettering, and it
was:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p class="center"><i>Hilaire O'Hagan ob. 1696 aetat 35.<br />
Parva domus, magna quies.</i></p></div>

<p>He sank down on his knees with a childish
sob. Sometimes the old church seemed absolutely
still, and the only sound to be heard
was the sighing of the night breeze below him
in the pines, but sometimes the place seemed
full of muffled movements, and once O'Hagan
could have sworn that the large carved handle
of the door turned. Even as he stood there
he heard steps just outside, and with a sudden
horror, he saw the heavy door slowly open.
A priest stood in the open doorway with an
inscrutable smile on his lips&mdash;the same clean-shaven
man with a long aquiline nose and
singularly square chin, that he had seen
before in his dreams.</p>

<p>"Brother," he said, in a moved voice.
"You must go back and help your comrades.
There is no peace for you yet. Yes, brother,
I know it is written that we shall rest from our
labours&mdash;but the beginning of our rest is not
yet. <i>We</i> must go and help them in the firing
line yonder&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, no, holy man!" O'Hagan pleaded.
"I have had enough.... There is hell over
there."</p>

<p>"They are calling us, don't you hear them&mdash;the
living and the dead&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>O'Hagan could see those great green flashes
that burst in the sky so near to him. He
could almost hear the angry zipping of high<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
explosive shrapnel close over his head. God!
how he hated it all!</p>

<p>"How hard it is, Father, to make these
children understand!" came softly from the
priest's lips.</p>

<p>O'Hagan's regiment had retired to their
trenches in good order. They were some of
those trenches round about Ypres, and all the
world has read how the Germans battered
and delivered terrific infantry attacks on this
part of our line without cessation. A certain
morning, about six o'clock, the Huns decided
to deliver a sharp attack, and there was
"considerable artillery activity" on the part
of the German guns. Such activity was
spoken of in the trenches as "raising the lid
off Hell." There was a lull after about an
hour's rain of every kind of missile that man
has invented to batter his brother with.
Then the Huns came on in earnest. Some
reached the trenches only to be met with a
murderous fire: they fell in little huddled
heaps in the blood and the mud and the slime
of the trenches. But the whole German race
seemed to be flowing in on the British, and
they fairly got into the trenches, though they
were twice driven out. Yard by yard the
battalion retired. The next moment an unearthly,
fluorescent light shot and flooded
along the trenches. The troops gasped for
a moment, and then started back. Standing
on a traverse in full view of Germans and
Englishmen was a tall man with yellow hair,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
in a priest's cassock. He was brandishing a
sword that flashed like a tongue of flame,
and crying "Turn back! turn back! advance!"</p>

<p>Private Hilaire O'Hagan, the deserter,
stood beside him holding a massive brass
altar cross above his head. From that
moment O'Hagan behaved like one possessed.
He hurled himself over the traverse into the
"green" of the German regiment, and started
hacking and stabbing with the pointed end of
the cross. The Huns did not like the look of
such a wild apparition and refused to face
him. Bit by bit they retired and O'Hagan
took advantage of a moment to take a green
silk Irish flag, with a crownless harp, from
his pocket, and attach it to the spike of the
cross. Then, roaring like a lion and brandishing
his strange weapon, he fell on them
once more&mdash;and as they broke he saw the
hooded priest driving them before him with
his flaming sword. A great joy seemed to
burn up in his soul. Men who watched him
said he ran amok. His great voice rose high
above the chattering machine guns in a
beautiful Franciscan chant and the voice of
the priest joined in. What O'Hagan, bearing
his mighty cross, must have looked like in
the eerie dawn mist, Heaven knows. But
seeing such an apparition and hearing the
strange chant, it is possible the Huns thought
the devil had joined in the fight. Then a
man in the rear trench pointed to the west,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
where a great image of the cross was shining
against a blood red sky, and a voice cried
"Forward." It passed from man to man,
and the regiment advanced, howling, with
O'Hagan. They drove the Germans before
them like chaff before a fan, and fell back, in
triumph, to their lost trenches. They saw
O'Hagan stagger a little and then turn round
to where the regiment boiled with joy in the
trenches.</p>

<p>"You are back, my children," he shouted.
"It is well, for my poor soul desires rest....
Aye, rest indeed!"</p>

<p>A great peace settled on O'Hagan's face, as
he slowly collapsed and lay very still.</p>

<p>Not long after this a country parson received
a letter from a hare-brained member
of his flock, who for many years had been
good enough to keep him in touch with his
doings in far lands. The old vicar had heard
that the "young scoundrel," as he called him,
had joined a volunteer regiment, and was in
the thick of the fighting around Ypres. The
letter was written in pencil on leaves torn
from a note-book. The portion that will
interest the reader of this story most is here
quoted.</p>

<p>"On Monday I came across an old friend
(?) of ours&mdash;Hilaire O'Hagan. We had a
brush with about five thousand Huns, and we
had under-estimated their strength. They
rushed us in the dawning&mdash;a living, greenish-grey
wave rolled over our trenches, shooting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
and hacking at the heart of what had once
been a regiment of British Infantry. When
the second wave lapped over, our men were
overborne but they were trying, by common
instinct, to reach the second line trenches
where they could re-form. Then I saw
O'Hagan who had dropped from God knows
where, standing silhouetted against the red
of dawn on the front line trench. He was
waving a brass cross and the bullets were
pattering around him and making a noise like
rats skipping about an empty house. My
God! Pluck! I never thought O'Hagan had
it in him. I tell you, he hurled himself down
on the rifles of a thousand Huns, and 'drove
them hence' with his mighty brass cross.
Our men were soon rallying on the lost trench.
The stragglers clutched at each other, and
pointed to where the cross flashed and reeled
in the seething mass. Under cover of night
our bearer party brought in O'Hagan stone
dead with over twenty bullet wounds in him.
I know, vicar, when you read this, it will
flash into your mind that poor O'Hagan had
been drinking again. You may banish any
such thought ... there was a different look
in O'Hagan's eyes. He had seen the 'immortal
light, all young and joyful, million-orbed,
million-coloured, as on the first morning.'
We carried him and his cross over to an
old monastery where we found one of those
quaint lead coffins&mdash;like the one in the crypt
in <i>our</i> old church&mdash;and laid him at rest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
beneath the cool blue flagstones outside the
chancel door. One of our men, a stone-mason
in times of peace, roughly graved his
name on the slab above him. As I walked
back to the trenches I turned back to have a
last look at the grave. A priest was standing
over it with hands outstretched to bless...."</p>
